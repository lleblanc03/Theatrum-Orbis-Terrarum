            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb><tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">Seeing, that as I thinke, there is no man, gentle Reader, but knoweth what, 
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and how great profit the knowledge of Histories doth bring to those which are serious students
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>therein; I doe verily believe and perswade my selfe, that there is almost no man, be it that he
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>have made neuer so little an entrance into the same, and touched them neuer so lightly, that is
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ignorant how necessary, for the understanding of them aright, the knowledge of </tei-hi>Geogra-
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>phy<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi"> is, which, in that respect therefore is of some, and not without just cause called The eye 
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>of history. For thou shalt meet with many things in the readings of Histories, (I will not say,
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>almost all) which, except thou have the knowledge of the countreys and places mentioned in
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>them, cannot onely not bee well conceived and understood, but also ost-times they are cleane
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>mistaken and otherwise understood then they ought to bee: which thing commeth to pass in many discourses: but especially
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>in the expeditions and voyages of great Kings, Captaines and Emperours: in the divers and sundry shirftings of Nations
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>from one place to another: and in the traveils and peregrinations of famous men, made into sundry countreys. But seeing
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>that this is a matter which even experience it selfe doeth teach us to be true, there is no reason why I should stand up
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>on the proofe of the same. This so necessary knowledge of </tei-hi>Geography<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">, as many worthy and learned men have testified,
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>may very easily be learn'd out of </tei-hi>Geographical charts<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi"> or Mappes. And when we have acquainted our selves somewhat
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>with the use of these </tei-hi>Tables<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi"> or Mappes, or have attained thereby to some reasonable knowledge of </tei-hi>Geography<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>we shall read, these </tei-hi>charts<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi"> being placed, as it were certaine glasses before our eye, will the longer be kept in memory, and
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>make the deeper impression in us: by which means it commeth to pass, that now we do seeme to perceive some fruit of that
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>which we have read. I omit here, that the reading of </tei-hi>Histories<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi"> does both seem to be much more pleasant, and in deed so
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>it is, when the Mappe being layed before our eyes, we may behold things done, or places where they were done, as if they were
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>at this time present and in doing. For how much we are holpen, when as in the Holy Scripture, we read of the journey of the
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> <tei-note type="historical" data-origname="note"><!--members of the anchient Hebrew nation.-->Israelites</tei-note>, which they made from </tei-hi><tei-placename ref="#egypt" data-origname="placeName">Egypt</tei-placename><tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">, through the Red sea, and that same huge Wildernesse, into the land of promise,
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>when as looking upon the Mappe of </tei-hi><tei-placename ref="#palestine" data-origname="placeName">Palestina</tei-placename><tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">, we doe almost aswell see it as if we were there, I think any student in Divini-
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>tie, or that History hath st made trial. Which things being so, how much those which are students and lovers of </tei-hi>Histories<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>are cornbred, hindred and stayd, yea, &amp; many times, even while they are in their race and continued course, drawne backe, it is
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>an easie matter to conceive, when either the description of all countreys cannot be gotten, or if they may be gotten, they are dea-
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>rer then that every mans money will reach and attaine unto especially those that are but poore, or none of the wealthiest.
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>For there are many that are much delighted with </tei-hi>Geography<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi"> or </tei-hi>Chorography<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi">, and especially with Mappes or Tables con-
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>tayning the plots and descriptions of Countreys, such as there are many now adayes extant and every where to be sold: Be
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>because that either they have not that, that should buy them; or if they have so much as they are worth, yet they will not lay it
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>out, they neglect them, neither do they any way satisfie themselves. Others there are who when they have that which will buy
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>them, would very willingly lay out the money, were it not that by reason of the narrownesse of the rooms and places, broad
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and large Mappes cannot be opened or spread, that every thing in them may easily and well be seene and discern'd. For, that
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>I may speake that which is the trueth, those great and large </tei-hi>Geographical<tei-hi rend="italic" data-origname="hi"> Maps or Charts, which are folded or rowl'd up,
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>are not so commodious; not when any thing is peraduenture read in them, so easie to be look'd upon. And be that will in or-
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>der hang them all along upon a wall, had need have not only a very large &amp; wide house, but even a Princess gallery or spacious
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Theatre. This I having of unmade trial of, I began to bethinke my selfe, what means might be found to redresse these discom-
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>modities, which I have spoken of, and either to make them somewhat lesse, or, if possibly might bee, to take them all cleane
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>away. And at length me thought it might be done by that means which we have obscured and set downe in this our booke, to
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>which I earnestly with that every student would afford a place in his Library, amongst the rest of his books.
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>	But that thou mayest the better understand, what it is that we have done in this our Theater, and what it is that thou
            <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>must expect and looke for in the same; I thinke it not amisse in few words briefly here to declare unto the. First
