<lb/>THE LIFE OF
<lb/>ABRAHAM ORTELL,
<lb/>COSMOGRAPHER TO PHILIP THE
<lb/>SECOND, LATE KING OF SPAINE,
<lb/>written first in Latine by Francis Sweert of Antwerpe, his familiar
<lb/>and louing friend, and now translated into English by
<lb/>W.B., as great a louer of his learning 
<lb/>and vertues.

<lb/>THe stocke of the ORTELS flourished not long since, and liued in good state and credit at
<lb/>Ausburg in Bayern, (Augustam vindelicorum, the Latines called it.) From that family came
<lb/>WILLIAM ORTELL, who about the yere of our Lord 1360 left his natiue country, and where he did many notable things worthily deseruing great commendation: among which 
<lb/>that is most memorable, that of his owne proper cost and charges he caused a goodly crosse
<lb/>of free stone to be set vp without the Emperours gate, in that place where the malefactours
<lb/>are vsusually woont to be executed and put to death. Beneath this crosse, at the base or foot
<lb/>of the same, stood Mary and Iohn, and beside them, a little farther off, hung the two theeues, the one vpon the 
<lb/>right hand and the other vpon the left, vpon thier seuerall gibbets. This William died on the seuenth day of Ia-
<lb/>nuary in the yeere of our Lord God 1511, and was buried in the cloisters of the Franciscane Friers in Antwerpe,
<lb/>leauing his sonne LEONARD ORTELL sole Exeutor, and heire, not only of his goods and substance, but also
<lb/>of his vertues and good qualities: for they report that he was a man so deuout and religious, that it was an hard 
<lb/>matter to finde him from his booke, serious meditation on heauly matters.
