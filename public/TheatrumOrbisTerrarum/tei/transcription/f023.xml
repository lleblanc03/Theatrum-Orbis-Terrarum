<lb/>This the Ancients have diuersly distinguished; but at this present it is divided by John Leo of
<lb/>Africa, into foure chiefe parts; Barbaria, Numidia, Libya, and the Land of Negros. Barbarie, 
<lb/>which is accounted the best, they circumscribe with the Atlantick &amp; Mediterranean seas; with 
<lb/>mount Atlas, &amp; whither region of Barca bordering upon Ægypt. Numidia, called by the 
<lb/>inhabitants Biledulgerid, and abounding with Dates (for which cause the Arabians call it by no 
<lb/>other name, but the Date-bearing region) is bounded Westward by the Atlantick Ocean; 
<lb/>Northward by mount Atlas; it stretcheth East as farre as the citie Caphsa, which is an hundred &amp; 
<lb/>fiftie miles distant from Ægypt; and the sande Deserts of Libya embrace it on the South. Libya 
<lb/>the third part, is named in the Arabian tongue Sura, which word signifies a Desert. It begins East 
<lb/>from Nilus, and thence runneth West as farre as the Atlantick sea; Numidia lies to the North of it, 
<lb/>and the Land of Negros to the South. Now followeth the fourth part, which they call Nigritarum or 
<lb/>Nigritania, either from the inhabitants, who are of a blacke colour, or from the river Niger, that 
<lb/>runneth thorow the countrey. It is bounded by Libya, South by the Æthiopick Ocean; West by 
<lb/>Guinee, and East by the Kingdome of Gago. And here we are to note, that according unto their 
<lb/>division, all Africa is included within the Mediterranean, Atlantick, and Æthiopick seas and the 
<lb/>river Nilus; whereof Ægypt and Abassia are accounted parts of it, which we not unworthily 
<lb/>therefore proper to belong to Africa. For the true Africa containes at this day Prester Johns 
<lb/>Empire, which by all late Writers is ascribed to Africa. Wherefore with Ptolomy indeed it ought to 
<lb/>be bound by the Mediterranean sea and Ocean seas, rather than by any river whatsoever; and 
<lb/>it hath the forme of a Peninsula, being joined toward Asia by an Isthmos of small neck-land, 
<lb/>which lies between the Mediterranean sea and the gulf of Arabia. The South part hereof was 
<lb/>unknowne to our ancestors, till the yeere 1497, whereas Vasco de Gama first doubling the Cape 
<lb/>of Bona Speranza, and passing about all Africa, came to Calecut in East India. This Southerne 
<lb/>part by the Persians and Arabians is called Zangibar.
<lb/>At the fore-sayd Cape of good hope the inhabitants are exceeding blacke; which we thought in 
<lb/>no wise to omit, because all men suppose the cause of blacknesse to be heat, and the 
<lb/>nearnesse of the Sunne; whereas the Sunne of it selfe forceth no more, than about the Streight 
<lb/>of Magellan (we measure the heat of the place, according to the position of the heavens and 
<lb/>distance from the Equinoctiall line) were now notwithstanding the people are reported to be 
<lb/>marvellous white. But if we will needs ascribe this blacknesse to the scorching of the Sun, let us 
<lb/>consider, that the same makes the Spaniards and Italians looke white; whereas they are equally 
<lb/>distant from the Equinoctiall with the inhabitants of the fore-sayd Cape; namely the one towards 
<lb/>the South, and the other towards the North. Prester Johns people are of a browne colour; in 
<lb/>Zanel and Mollala the inhabitants are cole blacke, yet all in one &amp; the same distance from the 
<lb/>equator, and under the very same parallell of the heavens. And on the contrary, why did 
<lb/>Herodotus and Pindarus describe such as inhabite the same climate with themselves, namely 
<lb/>Colches, to be a blacke people, and curled haired? Herodotus in his Thalia makes the Indians 
<lb/>blacke like the Æthiopians; which the experience of our times confirmeth. I know Herodotus will 
<lb/>have the cause hereof to be the seede of the parents, which he sayth is not whiter, than of other 
<lb/>people, but blacke. To whom Possidonius also subscribeth, and imputeth the matter of all this 
<lb/>blacknesse unto Canicular heate, against which opinion I have nothing to allege. Let the truth of 
<lb/>the matter rest upon the authors credit. But this as many men thinke more strange; that in all 
<lb/>America there were no black people found besides a few only in one place called by them 
<lb/>Quarequa. What then is the efficient cause of this colour? Is it the drinesse of the heavens, or of 
<lb/>the earth? is it perhaps some hidden propriety of the soile? Or a kind of fat licentious nature in 
<lb/>the nature of men? Or is it all these variances in one? But these things we leave to be 
<lb/>considered by them, who more curiously search into the secrets of nature.
<lb/>This portion of the world is called by the Greeks Libya, and by the Latines Africa, because it is 
<lb/>not moistened with extremity of cold: or (if we may credit some) of Afer one of the adventurers 
<lb/>posterity. Another derivation of the name you have (set downe by John Leo in the description of 
<lb/>his booke of the Description of Africa), who deriveth it from one blacke African, springing of the 
<lb/>stocke of Cham, who first inhabited that part of the Mediterranean sea, from Atlas, bounded by 
<lb/>the river Nilus, or rather as the best authors have taught us, the African soile called of the 
<lb/>Greekes Aphrice, Marce rubrum, and red sea. Herodotus reporteth, that Africa was first 
<lb/>unknowne till Cesars time, when it was found to be a third part of the inhabited world. Plinie the 
<lb/>like, and so doth Solinus. Caesar Scaliger gathereth of the word Africa, that it is a name of the 
<lb/>same import with aprica, that is, a sunne-shining place; for that this land lying open on every 
<lb/>side to the Sunnes visitation, seemed thereby to have beene named so little other than of 
<lb/>apricity. The principall regions of Africa have amongst themselves (as it were) a threefold 
<lb/>division: first, from Atlas in the West to the red sea and Arabia, whence it took the name of the 
<lb/>first inhabiters, or else from the colour of the people, for the most part blacke and duskie; the 
<lb/>second, to wit, the inner part of Africa, from Nilus to the Kingdome of Congo, is more temperate, 
<lb/>and not so much subject to the Sunnes heate; the third, which is next unto the South Pole, by 
<lb/>reason of the obliquity of the Zodiack, is more temperate than the former. The islands that 
<lb/>belong to Africa (some of which are expressed in the table) are Madagascar, the Canaries, the 
<lb/>Isles of Cape Verde, and St. Thomas situated under the equinoctiall, which aboundeth with 
<lb/>fruits.
<lb/>Among the ancient Writers none have particularly described this region. But concerning the 
<lb/>same saith Isidore in his Etymologies; Hanno his navigation about Africa, in diversities; and 
<lb/>Iambulus his voyages, in Diodorus Siculus; and likewise Herodotus his Melpomene. 
<lb/>Bartholomeus de Glanvilla in his Image of the World reporteth the like. Of late Writers reade 
<lb/>also the Commentaries of Vasco de Gama, Franciscus Alvares, who travelled Æthiopia. But of 
<lb/>all others John Leo hath most exactly described it; as also Andrew Thevet, and Francis Alvarez, 
<lb/>both travellers of Africa. Concerning the river Nilus, the greatest in all the world, you have the 
<lb/>letters of John Ramusio and Jerome Fracastorius. Of Africa itself, as by me read at large in the 
<lb/>second volume of Mr. Richard Hakluyts English Voyages.
