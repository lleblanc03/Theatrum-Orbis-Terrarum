<lb/>ASIA
<lb/>Asia diuides it selfe from Europe by the river Tanais, and a streight line drawen
<lb/>from the fountaines thereof to the Bay of S. Nicolas in the North Ocean:
<lb/>but from Africa, by the neck-land Ifthmos or narrow place of the earth, which
<lb/>in betweene the Arabian gulfe and the Mediterran sea. The residue thereof the
<lb/>Ocean and other seas do enuiron.
<lb/>
<lb/>This part the ancient Geographers, as Strabo in his eleuenth booke, and Ar-
<lb/>rianus in his fift booke, haue dinersly divided. But at this present it may be us not altogether un-
<lb/>fitly be distributed into fine parts, according to the great Empires by which it is gouerned. The first
<lb/>whereof, which bordereth upon Europe, and is subiect to the great Duke of Mofcouia, is bounded
<lb/>by the Frozen sea, the riuer Ob, the lake Kitaia, and a line drawen from thence to the Caspian sea,
<lb/>and by the Isthmus or neck-land between the Caspian and Euxin seas. The second is that, which
<lb/>yields obedience to the great Cham Emperour of the Tartars, whole Southern borders are the Caspi-
<lb/>an sea, the riuer Iaxartest, and mount Imaus; on the East and North it is begirt with the Ocean;
<lb/>and Westward it confines vpon the dominions of the foresaid great Duke of Russia. The third part,
<lb/>the progeinie of the Ottomans or the Turkish Emperour enioyes, which containeth whatsoeuer re-
<lb/>gions are situate within the compasse of the Euxin sea, the aegean sea (now called Arcipelago)
<lb/>and the Mediterranean sea, the land of Egypt, the Arabian and Persian seas, the riuer Tigris, the Ca-
<lb/>spian sea, and the Isthmos or neck-land between it and the sea Euxine. Vnder the fourth shalbe com-
<lb/>prised the Kingdome of Persia, now gouerned by the Sophies; Westward it hat the Turkes, with
<lb/>whom the Persian for the most part manteineth continuall warres; Northward the Empire of the
<lb/>great Cham; Eastward it extends almost to the riuer Indus; and on the south it is restrained by the
<lb/>sea, at this present called Indicum, but in times past Mare Rubrum, or The Red sea. Now the
<lb/>sift part takes vp all that remaineth, which as in times past, so at this present, is called The Indies;
<lb/>neither is it gouerned by one only, as the former; but by many pety Kings, euery region almost hauing
<lb/>a peculiar Gouernour, some which are tributarie to the great Cham. And here it is not to be omitted,
<lb/>that all the sea-coasts from the Arabian gulfe, to the Promontory of China, commonly called Cabo
<lb/>de Lampo, situate in 30. degrees of Northerly latitude, are in a maner possessed, or made tributary
<lb/>to the Portugals. 
<lb/>
<lb/>Amongst infitinte others, the princpall isles ascribed to Asia, are Cyprus and Rhodes in the
<lb/>Mediterran sea; Zeilan of the vulgar and Taprobana well knowento the ancients now called Sa-
<lb/>motra, but falsly Sumatra, in the Indick-Ocean, where also within the memory of our fathers, the
<lb/>Portugals haue discouered the two Iauas, with the isles of Borneo, Celebes, Palohan, andMin-
<lb/>danao; and here likewise Gilolo, and the Moluccos, at this day famous for abundance of spi-
<lb/>ces which they yeeld. To these may be added the isles of Iapan, and new Guinie very lately descried;
<lb/>but this last, whether it be an island, or adioyned to the South maine, it is not yet Certainly knowen.
<lb/>
<lb/>The memorie of this part of the world is most renowmed, not only with prophane authors (as they 
<lb/>terme them) in regard of the first monarchies established by the Assyrians, the Persians, the Babylo-
<lb/>nians, and the Medes; but in the holy Scriptures also it is more famous than the rest: for here man-
<lb/>kinde was not only created by almightie God, deluded and corrupted by the enemie Satan, and resto-
<lb/>red by our Saviour Christ; but we finde almost all the hestories in either Testament to haue beene in
<lb/>this part both written and accomplished.
<lb/>Strabo hath described Asia in six books, namely from the 11. booke vnto the 16. Ptolomey hath
<lb/>decyphered the fame in three, as in his 5. 6. And 7. books; and likewise in 12. Geographicall Tables,
<lb/>and ascribes unto it 40. prouinces. It is also let foorth by Ammianus Marcellinus in his 23.
<lb/>booke, and by Diodorus Siculus in the beginning of his 18. Of late Writers none haue wholly and
<lb/>particularly described it. M. Paulus Venetus, Lewes of Barthema, and St. Iohn Mandeuile,
<lb/>(but this Authour is fraught with tables) haue written so much thereof, as by trauelling the regions,
<lb/>they found worthie of obseruation. Reade also the Epistle of Iacobus Nauarca a Fesuite.
<lb/>        I my selfe likewise certaine yeeres past set forth a large Map the description of the same.
