<lb/> <title><placeName>Evrope</placeName></title>
<lb/><p>In the diuision of the world, diuers haue placed <placeName>Africa</placeName> in the third part : some few haue made no more but <placeName>Asia</placeName> and <placeName>Europe</placeName> only ; and <placeName>Africa</placeName> they make a part of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, saith <persName>Salustius</persName>. This is that which <persName>S. Paulinus</persName> in <placeName>Aulonius</placeName>, out o
<lb/> the opinion of the same Saluit, thus writeth of : <foreign xml:lang="la">Europam Afiamque duo vel maxima terrae Membra, quibus Lybiam
<lb/>dubie Sallustius addit, Europæ admixtram : poffit quum tertia dici</foreign> : <placeName>Europe</placeName> and <placeName>Asia</placeName> vast, the Earthly globe between 
<lb/>them share. Yet whether <placeName>Africke</placeName> should a part of this our <placeName>Europe</placeName> be ; or make a third part by it selfe, Saluit doth doubt 
<lb/>I see. But <persName>Philostratus</persName> also in <persName>Isocrates</persName> doth diuide the world into <placeName>Asia</placeName> and <placeName>Europe</placeName> : yea <persName>Isocrates</persName> himself, in his Pane-
<lb/>gyricos. Moreouer in <persName>Varroes</persName> booke <foreign xml:lang="la">De lingua Latina</foreign> these words are read ; As all the world is diuided into <placeName>Heaven</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Earth</placeName> : so <placeName>Heaven</placeName> is seuered into his quarters : and the <placeName>Earth</placeName> into <placeName>Asia</placeName> and <placeName>Europe</placeName>. Againe the same author in his 
<lb/>booke of Husbandrie writeth thus : first, when as the world, by <persName>Eratosthenes</persName>, was very fully and naturally divided into 
<lb/>two parts, the one toward the South, [<placeName>Asia</placeName> doubtlesse he meaneth ] the other in the north [<placeName>Europe</placeName> we call it.] <persName>S. Augu-
<lb/>stine</persName> in his 16. booke <foreign xml:lang="la">De Ciuitate Dei</foreign> : <persName>Lucane</persName> in his 9. booke: and <persName>Orosius</persName> in the first booke of his history, haue the like
<lb/>wordes to the same sense. Notwithstanding custome since hath preuailed with all historiographers and cosmographers which haue written either in Latine 
<lb/>or Greeke, ioinly to diuide the globe of the earth into these three parts: <placeName>Asia</placeName>, <placeName>Africke</placeName> and <placeName>Europe</placeName>: the last of which we have taken vpon vs to describe in 
<lb/>this place, not only in forme of a mappe or chart, like a Geographer: but in this present discourse, like an historian. Concerning the forme of it therefore, it 
<lb/>is manifold, as <persName>Strabo</persName> writeth. It is a Peninsula or demy-isle, and not an island; although <persName>Silenus</persName>, as <persName>Elianus</persName> writeth, did sometime to <persName>Midas</persName> so relate of
<lb/>it. For it is on all sides, as you may see in the mappe, bounded and beaten with the salt sea, but only upon the East, where it is by a small necke ioined to the 
<lb/>greater <placeName>Asia</placeName>. Yet by what limits they are there distinguished, the ancient and the later writers do not altogether agree. For those which are more ancient 
<lb/>as <persName>Aristotle</persName>, <persName>Plato</persName>, <persName>Herodotus</persName>, and others which do follow their opinion, do diuide <placeName>Europe</placeName> from <placeName>Asia</placeName>, by the riuer <placeName>Phasis</placeName>, (a riuer of Colchis falling 
<lb/>into the <placeName>Euxine sea</placeName>, <placeName>Mar Maiore</placeName>, or <foreign xml:lang="la">Maurothalassa</foreign>, as the greeks call it) neere <placeName>Trapezonda</placeName> : some mappes do now call that riuer <placeName>Fasso</placeName>, others <placeName>Phaz-
<lb/>zeth</placeName>: the Scythians, (as <persName>Theuet</persName> reporteth, Debbaffethca) or which is all one, by that ithmos or neckland which is between the forefaid <placeName>Mar Maiore</placeName> or 
<lb/><placeName>Pontus Euxinus</placeName>, and the <placeName>Caspian sea</placeName> (<placeName>Mar de Cachu</placeName>, the ancient called it <placeName>Mare Hyrcanum</placeName>, the <placeName>Hyrcanie sea</placeName>) which formerly all old writers thought to 
<lb/>be but a bay or gulfe of the Scythian or Northren ocean, as <persName>Strabo</persName>, <persName>Pliny</persName>, <persName>Mela</persName>, <persName>Dionysius</persName>, <persName>Plutarch</persName> (in the life of <persName>Alexander</persName> and in his discourse of the 
<lb/>face in the sphere of the Moone) and <persName>Iornandes</persName> a more late writer, have first recorded. Yet all of them were deceiued. Only <persName>Herodotus</persName> truly (as this 
<lb/>our latter age doth approve and find to be so) doth affirme this to be a sea of it selfe, and to have neither in-let nor out-let, or to be intermeddled with any other 
<lb/>sea. <persName>Dionysius</persName>, <persName>Arrianus</persName>, <persName>Diodorus</persName>, <persName>Polybius</persName>, <persName>Iornandes</persName> and <persName>Ptolemey</persName> have diuided it from <placeName>Asia</placeName> by the riuer <placeName>Tanais</placeName> (<placeName>Don</placeName> or <placeName>Tana</placeName>, as now the 
<lb/>Italians name it) who think that both the rise of this riuer, and the land Northward from where it commeth, are both unknown and uncertaine. All 
<lb/>doubt where to place and lay their bounds : as indeed who never perfectly knew those places toward the East and North, not being then discovered, but only 
<lb/>described by them, from the fabulous reports of others: as for example, the <placeName>Riphæan</placeName> and <placeName>Hyperboræan</placeName> mountaines, which are fained inventions of the 
<lb/>Greekes, as <persName>Strabo</persName> writeth: together with Aluani montes, heere described by <persName>Ptolemey</persName>, where not only these mountaines, but also no other at this 
<lb/>day, are to be seene: but in their places diuers huge and vast woods, great fennes and bogges, or large champion plaines. <persName>Orpheus</persName> also long since described 
<lb/>in this part of the continent I meane, between <placeName>Mæotis palus</placeName>, the <placeName>fenne Mæotis</placeName>, (now called <placeName>Mar delle Zabbache</placeName>, and <placeName>Mardella Tana</placeName>) and the <placeName>sea
<lb/>Cronium</placeName>, an huge wood. Likewise, <persName>Dionysius</persName> after heereabouts placeth an infinite wood, as he termeth it, from whence he saith <placeName>Tanais</placeName> or <placeName>Don</placeName> doth
<lb/>spring, which after many windings and turnings at last falleth into the forenamed <placeName>fenne Maeotis</placeName>. <persName>Isidorus</persName> heere hath the <placeName>Riphaean woods</placeName>, in which he
<lb/>saith <placeName>Tanais</placeName> doth first take the beginning. That <placeName>Donaw</placeName> (Danubis) doth diuide <placeName>Asia</placeName> from <placeName>Europe</placeName>, Seneca in the sixth booke Naturall doth manifestly
<lb/>affirm; of which his opinion, what do we thinke, we will, God willing, set downe in the discourse to the Mappe of <placeName>Dacia</placeName>. Hitherto we see the forenamed au-
<lb/>thours to doubt and disagree between themselues of the limits of these two parts of the world: if therefore they shall find me a meet vmpier and arbitratour
<lb/>in this matter, I would, not vnfitly, and as I hope to the liking of all parties, decide the controuer thus: I would make the bounds to be <placeName>Tanais</placeName>, or the ri-
<lb/>uer <placeName>Don</placeName>; the straits or narrow peece of the maine land that is between the riuer and the <placeName>riuer Rha</placeName> (Athel), which emptyeth it selfe into the <placeName>Caspian sea</placeName>:
<lb/>the East branch of the same Athel: then from his head vnto the <placeName>riuer Oby</placeName>, and so even vnto his mouth or fall into the <placeName>Northren sea</placeName>: For by this mouth, I
<lb/>do easily perswade my selfe, that antiquity did verily beleeue that the <placeName>Caspian sea</placeName> did vnlade it selfe into the maine Ocean. For that the name of this <placeName>riuer O-
<lb/>by</placeName> is ancient, it is very likely, for that <placeName>montes Obij</placeName>, certain mountaines called <placeName>Obij</placeName> are placed heere about in this tract, by <persName>Athenaeus</persName>, which he saith for-
<lb/>merly were called of the ancient <placeName>montes Riphæi</placeName>, the <placeName>Riphaean hils</placeName>: but then in his daies <placeName>montes Alpes</placeName>, the <placeName>Alpes</placeName>. Againe <persName>Iornandes</persName> in this continent,
<lb/>not farre from hence, describeth Ovim or Obim, a Scythian nation or family. And that these foresaid mountaines are in this place (not where <persName>Ptolemey</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>Pomponius Mela</persName> haue placed them) very many men of great credit and learning in these our daies, sufficient witnesses do stoutly auouch. Amongst
<lb/>which <persName>Baro Herberftein</persName>, in his history of <placeName>Moscouy</placeName>, is one: <persName>Paul Oderborne</persName>, in his treatise written of the life of <persName>Bafilides</persName>, is another: lastly, <persName>Antony
<lb/>Wied</persName>, in his mappe of <placeName>Moscouy</placeName> may be the third. Now they name it vulgarly by diuers and sundrie names, but commonly they call it <placeName>Cingulum mundi</placeName>,
<lb/>The girdle of the world, as the said <persName>Herberftein</persName> doth affirme. In a mappe of these countries set out by <persName>Master Jenkinson</persName>, an Englishman, who travelled
<lb/>through these parts, it is called <placeName>Zona Orbis</placeName>, The girdle of the Earth. Moreouer I haue in some sort for this diuision, <persName>Iornandes</persName> and <persName>AEthicus</persName>, upon my 
<lb/>side, where they say that the <placeName>Riphean mountaines</placeName> do part <placeName>Asia</placeName> and <placeName>Europe</placeName>. Againe these selfe same hils, yea, and in this tract, are the <placeName>montes Hyperbo-
<lb/>rei</placeName>; not where <persName>Ptolemey</persName> placeth them. And they are the same with montes <placeName>Riphæi</placeName>, <placeName>Obij</placeName>, and <placeName>Alpes</placeName>. Thus farre of the diusion of <placeName>Asia</placeName> from <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
<lb/>        <p><persName>Pliny</persName> calleth this part of the world, The Nurce of all Nations; <persName>Mardonius</persName>, as <persName>Herodotus</persName> doth tell of him, auoucheth it to <persName>Xerxes</persName>, to be by farre 
<lb/>the beautifulleft of all places of the World, to be a most goodly and gallant country, yielding all maner of fruits and fruitfull trees and those
<lb/>in their kindes and best; and to be such that it were pity that any king in the World should haue ought to do in but he. Varro in his bo kes Dere 
<lb/>Rustica, of Husbandrie writeth, That it is a more temperate and healthful soile than <placeName>Asia</placeName>. <placeName>Statius</placeName> in his Achilleidos, more than once or twice, calleth
<lb/>it, The Mighty prouince of the World. <foreign xml:lang="la">Maximaterra viris &amp; fœcundissima doctis Vrbibus</foreign>, <placeName>Europe</placeName> for multitude of warlike men and scholers 
<lb/>deeply learned, doth farre excell thus <persName>Mamilius</persName> writeth of it. <persName>Aristotle</persName>, the prince of Philospophers, maketh the inhabiters of this part of the world, to be, 
<lb/>A very stout and couragious people. The same authour affirmeth, that, All kind of beasts and cattell heere, are in their kind, greater, and stronger 
<lb/>than in <placeName>Asia</placeName> and <placeName>Africke</placeName>. But of the nature of this country, the maners and customes of the people, let vs heare what <placeName>Strabo</placeName> that excellent Geographer saith
<lb/>in his second book ; This part is most fertile of valiant and prudent men. It is all generally habitable, excepting only a very small portion toward 
<lb/>the North, and abutting vpon the Hamaxici, which dwell vpon <placeName>Tanais</placeName>, <placeName>Don</placeName> Meo'is Palus (<placeName>Mar delle Zabacche</placeName>) and <placeName>Borysthenes</placeName> (<placeName>Nieper</placeName> or
<lb/><placeName>Dnester</placeName>) which place, by reason of the extream cold, is not habitable. Yet certaine bleake and mountainous places inhabited, although in re-
<lb/>spect of the nature of the soile they are tilled and manured with greater difficulty, yet having gotten good skilull and industrious husbands,
<lb/>those also are tamed and much bettered, which heeretofore were badly vsed, and kept only by theeues and out-lawes. And indeed the Greekes
<lb/>when they dwelt vpon the rocks and mountaines, dwelt well and conueniently, by reason of their wise cariage in ciuill matters, arts, sciences and 
<lb/>knowledge of those things, which necessarily are required to the maintenance of mans life. In like maner the Romanes, hauing brought many 
<lb/>sauage and fierce Nations vnder their seruile yoke, seated, I meane, in places not very conuenient to dwell in, in respect of the nature of the coun- 
<lb/>try, either for that it was rough and craggy, or wanted hauens, or was too bleake and cold, or for other causes, taught them to vse merchandise
<lb/>before vnknowen, and haue brought them from a sauage and brutish life, to live ciuilly and more humanely. But those parts which are situate in
<lb/>an equall and temperat climate, there nature administreth all things necessary for the maintenance of man and beast. Now when as those Nations
<lb/>which do inhabite and dwell in fertile and rich countries, are maintainers of peace and quietnesse ; and those which are seated in barren and vn-
<lb/>fruitfull countries, are most hardy and stout : it commeth to passe that both are helpfull one to another ; while these do vse their weapons for 
<lb/>their countries defence, those againe do help and maintaine them by the profits that they raise out of the earth, by their arts and mysteries, as also
<lb/>by their learning, wisedome and policy : euen as in like maner also the dammage is mutuall and either side feeleth a sensible hurt, when the one
<lb/>part doth not helpe the other : yet the estate of the souldier and warlike man is somewhat better, if they be not ouercome with multitude. And
<lb/>the nature of <placeName>Europe</placeName> serueth very fitly for this purpose : for it is all diuersly distinguished by lofty mountaines and lowly plaines ; so that euery
<lb/>where the husbandmen and soldiers ; the politicians and the martiall warriers do dwell together : yet so as the greatest number are peaceable
<lb/>men : which kind of life they enjoy especially by the meanes and labour of their captaines, first of the Greekes, then of the Macedonians, and
<lb/>lastly of the Romanes. Therefore both in peace and warre it is sufficient of itselfe to maintaine and defend itselfe : for it hath great plenty both
<lb/>of stout soldiers, painfull husbandmen, and politique statesmen. In this also it doth excel, that it bringeth foorth passing good fruits, such I
<lb/>meane, as are necessary for the maintenance of mans life: with all sorts of mettall, for what vse soeuer. Spices or sweet smelling things and preti- 
<lb/>ous stones, are brought hither from forren countries, WHICH THINGS WHOSOEVER HAVE NOT, THEY LIVE NEVER A WHIT 
<lb/>WORSE THAN THOSE DO THAT HAVE THEM. Moreouer this is especially worth the noting, that hauing wonderfull store of cattell, 
<lb/>sheep and oxen ; it breedeth very few dangerous wild beasts. Thus farre the learned <persName>Strabo</persName>. Many other things thou maist read of this <placeName>Europe</placeName>,
<lb/>together with the nature and condition of the people of the same, in that treatise which <persName>Hippocrates</persName>, the prince of Physitions, wrote of the aire and waters.
<lb/>This <placeName>Europe</placeName> also, and not any other place of the world beside, doth yeeld Succinum or Electrum, (Amber we call it, the Germanes, Glessum) yet it is not 
<lb/>found in <placeName>Eridianus</placeName>, a river falling into some Northren sea, as <persName>Herodotus</persName> doth fabulously report : or in <placeName>Padus</placeName>, a riuer of Italy (Po) as the poets iestingly af-
<lb/>firme: nor in the Electrides, certaine fained ilands in the <placeName>Hadriaticke sea</placeName>, as some men of better credit, and more diligent searchers out of the <supplied reason="illegible">t</supplied>ruth, as <persName>Pliny</persName></p>

<lb/><personalstmt><!--Transcribed and Encoded by Avery Slavin--></personalstmt>This the Ancients have diuersly distinguished; but at this present it is divided by <persName>John Leo</persName> of
<lb/> <placeName>Africa</placeName>, into foure chiefe parts; <placeName>Barbaria</placeName>, <placeName>Numidia</placeName>, <placeName>Libya</placeName>, and the Land of Negros. <placeName>Barbarie</placeName>, 
<lb/>which is accounted the best, they circumscribe with the <placeName>Atlantick</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Mediterranean seas</placeName>; with 
<lb/>mount Atlas, &amp; whither region of Barca bordering upon <placeName>Ægypt</placeName>. <placeName>Numidia</placeName>, called by the 
<lb/>inhabitants Biledulgerid, and abounding with Dates (for which cause the Arabians call it by no 
<lb/>other name, but the Date-bearing region) is bounded Westward by the <placeName>Atlantick Ocean</placeName>; 
<lb/>Northward by mount Atlas; it stretcheth East as farre as the citie <placeName>Caphsa</placeName>, which is an hundred &amp; 
<lb/>fiftie miles distant from <placeName>Ægypt</placeName>; and the sande <placeName>Deserts of Libya</placeName> embrace it on the South. <placeName>Libya</placeName>
<lb/>the third part, is named in the Arabian tongue Sura, which word signifies a Desert. It begins East 
<lb/>from <placeName>Nilus</placeName>, and thence runneth West as farre as the <placeName>Atlantick sea</placeName>; <placeName>Numidia</placeName> lies to the North of it, 
<lb/>and the Land of Negros to the South. Now followeth the fourth part, which they call <placeName>Nigritarum</placeName> or 
<lb/><placeName>Nigritania</placeName>, either from the inhabitants, who are of a blacke colour, or from the <placeName>river Niger</placeName>, that 
<lb/>runneth thorow the countrey. It is bounded by <placeName>Libya</placeName>, South by the <placeName>Æthiopick Ocean</placeName>; West by 
<lb/><placeName>Guinee</placeName>, and East by the <placeName>Kingdome of Gago</placeName>. And here we are to note, that according unto their 
<lb/>division, all <placeName>Africa</placeName> is included within the <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName>, <placeName>Atlantick</placeName>, and <placeName>Æthiopick</placeName> seas and the 
<lb/><placeName>river Nilus</placeName>; whereof <placeName>Ægypt</placeName> and <placeName>Abassia</placeName> are accounted parts of it, which we not unworthily 
<lb/>therefore proper to belong to <placeName>Africa</placeName>. For the true <placeName>Africa</placeName> containes at this day <persName>Prester Johns</persName> 
<lb/>Empire, which by all late Writers is ascribed to <placeName>Africa</placeName>. Wherefore with Ptolomy indeed it ought to 
<lb/>be bound by the <placeName>Mediterranean sea</placeName> and Ocean seas, rather than by any river whatsoever; and 
<lb/>it hath the forme of a Peninsula, being joined toward <placeName>Asia</placeName> by an Isthmos of small neck-land, 
<lb/>which lies between the <placeName>Mediterranean sea</placeName> and the <placeName>gulf of Arabia</placeName>. The South part hereof was 
<lb/>unknowne to our ancestors, till the yeere <date when="1497">1497</date>, whereas Vasco de Gama first doubling the <placeName>Cape 
of Bona Speranza</placeName>, and passing about all <placeName>Africa</placeName>, came to <placeName>Calecut in East India</placeName>. This Southerne 
<lb/>part by the Persians and Arabians is called <placeName>Zangibar</placeName>.
<lb/>At the fore-sayd Cape of good hope the inhabitants are exceeding blacke; which we thought in 
<lb/>no wise to omit, because all men suppose the cause of blacknesse to be heat, and the 
<lb/>nearnesse of the Sunne; whereas the Sunne of it selfe forceth no more, than about the Streight 
<lb/>of <placeName>Magellan</placeName> (we measure the heat of the place, according to the position of the heavens and 
<lb/>distance from the Equinoctiall line) were now notwithstanding the people are reported to be 
<lb/>marvellous white. But if we will needs ascribe this blacknesse to the scorching of the Sun, let us 
<lb/>consider, that the same makes the Spaniards and Italians looke white; whereas they are equally 
<lb/>distant from the Equinoctiall with the inhabitants of the fore-sayd Cape; namely the one towards 
<lb/>the South, and the other towards the North. <persName>Prester Johns</persName> people are of a browne colour; in 
<lb/><placeName>Zanel</placeName> and <placeName>Mollala</placeName> the inhabitants are cole blacke, yet all in one &amp; the same distance from the 
<lb/>equator, and under the very same parallell of the heavens. And on the contrary, why did 
<lb/><persName>Herodotus</persName> and <persName>Pindarus</persName> describe such as inhabite the same climate with themselves, namely 
<lb/>Colches, to be a blacke people, and curled haired? <persName>Herodotus</persName> in his Thalia makes the Indians 
<lb/>blacke like the Æthiopians; which the experience of our times confirmeth. I know <persName>Herodotus</persName> will 
<lb/>have the cause hereof to be the seede of the parents, which he sayth is not whiter, than of other 
<lb/>people, but blacke. To whom Possidonius also subscribeth, and imputeth the matter of all this 
<lb/>blacknesse unto Canicular heate, against which opinion I have nothing to allege. Let the truth of 
<lb/>the matter rest upon the authors credit. But this as many men thinke more strange; that in all 
<lb/><placeName>America</placeName> there were no black people found besides a few only in one place called by them 
<lb/><placeName>Quarequa</placeName>. What then is the efficient cause of this colour? Is it the drinesse of the heavens, or of 
<lb/>the earth? is it perhaps some hidden propriety of the soile? Or a kind of fat licentious nature in 
<lb/>the nature of men? Or is it all these variances in one? But these things we leave to be 
<lb/>considered by them, who more curiously search into the secrets of nature.
<lb/>This portion of the world is called by the Greeks <placeName>Libya</placeName>, and by the Latines <placeName>Africa</placeName>, because it is 
<lb/>not moistened with extremity of cold: or (if we may credit some) of Afer one of the adventurers 
<lb/>posterity. Another derivation of the name you have (set downe by <persName>John Leo</persName> in the description of 
<lb/>his booke of the Description of <placeName>Africa</placeName>), who deriveth it from one blacke African, springing of the 
<lb/>stocke of Cham, who first inhabited that part of the <placeName>Mediterranean sea</placeName>, from <placeName>Atlas</placeName>, bounded by 
<lb/>the <placeName>river Nilus</placeName>, or rather as the best authors have taught us, the African soile called of the 
<lb/>Greekes Aphrice, Marce rubrum, and red sea. <persName>Herodotus</persName> reporteth, that <placeName>Africa</placeName> was first 
<lb/>unknowne till <persName>Cesars</persName> time, when it was found to be a third part of the inhabited world. Plinie the 
<lb/>like, and so doth Solinus. <persName>Caesar Scaliger</persName> gathereth of the word <placeName>Africa</placeName>, that it is a name of the 
<lb/>same import with aprica, that is, a sunne-shining place; for that this land lying open on every 
<lb/>side to the Sunnes visitation, seemed thereby to have beene named so little other than of 
<lb/>apricity. The principall regions of <placeName>Africa</placeName> have amongst themselves (as it were) a threefold 
<lb/>division: first, from <placeName>Atlas</placeName> in the West to the red sea and <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, whence it took the name of the 
<lb/>first inhabiters, or else from the colour of the people, for the most part blacke and duskie; the 
<lb/>second, to wit, the inner part of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, from <placeName>Nilus</placeName> to the <placeName>Kingdome of Congo</placeName>, is more temperate, 
<lb/>and not so much subject to the Sunnes heate; the third, which is next unto the <placeName>South Pole</placeName>, by 
<lb/>reason of the obliquity of the Zodiack, is more temperate than the former. The islands that 
<lb/>belong to <placeName>Africa</placeName> (some of which are expressed in the table) are <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>, <placeName>the Canaries</placeName>, the 
<lb/><placeName>Isles of Cape Verde</placeName>, and <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> situated under the equinoctiall, which aboundeth with 
<lb/>fruits.
<lb/>Among the ancient Writers none have particularly described this region. But concerning the 
<lb/>same saith Isidore in his Etymologies; <persName>Hanno</persName> his navigation about <placeName>Africa</placeName>, in diversities; and 
<lb/><persName>Iambulus</persName> his voyages, in Diodorus Siculus; and likewise <persName>Herodotus</persName> his Melpomene. 
<lb/><persName>Bartholomeus de Glanvilla</persName> in his Image of the World reporteth the like. Of late Writers reade 
<lb/>also the Commentaries of <persName>Vasco de Gama</persName>, <persName>Franciscus Alvares</persName>, who travelled <placeName>Æthiopia</placeName>. But of 
<lb/>all others <persName>John Leo</persName> hath most exactly described it; as also <persName>Andrew Thevet</persName>, and <persName>Francis Alvarez</persName>, 
<lb/>both travellers of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. Concerning the <placeName>river Nilus</placeName>, the greatest in all the world, you have the 
<lb/>letters of <persName>John Ramusio</persName> and <persName>Jerome Fracastorius</persName>. Of <placeName>Africa itself</placeName>, as by me read at large in the 
<lb/>second volume of <persName>Mr. Richard Hakluyts</persName> English Voyages.
