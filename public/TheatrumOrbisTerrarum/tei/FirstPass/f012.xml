<lb/> tongue, ( to wit, Hungary, Transsyluania, Polonia, Scandia, and Rusia.) Thus hausing finished Europe, we come vn-
<lb/>to the Isthmus or Straight-land, which is between the head of the River Tanais and the North sea, which is in deed the
<lb/>bound of Europe and Asia : from it we step into Asia. Which, after we have a while beheld, we left, and so passed into Afri-
<lb/>ca, by the Streights, or narrow piece of the Mainland, which runneth between the Bay of Arabia, and the gulfe of Damiata,
<lb/>(Sirbonus Lacus) made by the ouerflowing of the Midland-sea. From thence passing through Egypt and Barabry wee
<lb/>came vnto the Streights of Gibraltar, which we crossed, and at the length came home againe to our owne natiue countrey from
<lb/>whence we first set foote; like vnto a trauailer or a Pilgrime, which hath viewed and trauailed through many and sundry
<lb/>seuerall Nations and Countreys, pasing out of one into another, orderly as they lay and we situate one by another, ouer-
<lb/>skipping none, at last returneth lasely and ioyfully from whence he first set foorth.
<lb/> Thus farre of the Mappes themselues: Now let vs speake a word or two of the backside of the same. Because we thought
<lb/>it would be a thing nothing pleasing to the Reader or Beholder, to see the backsides of the leaues altogether bare and empty;
<lb/>we determined there to make a certaine briefe and short declaration and Historical discourse of euery Mappe, in the same
<lb/>manner and order as we said we obserued in the Mappes themselues; omitting nor concealing any mans name, that we had oc-
<lb/>casion to vse. Moreouer to these also we have added a Table of the names of all the Authors, that euer wee knew or had;
<lb/>out of which, those that are so disposed, may fetch a more ample and larger [discowse] and description of the seurall Countreys
<lb/>handled by them.  Wherefore the students of Geography shall haue here, in the Authours thus named in order, and in the 
<lb/>Catalogue of the Authours of the Geographicall Tables or Mappes, which we have set before this our worke, and lastly in 
<lb/>these Tables themselues, a certaine shoppe, as it were, furnished with all kinde of instruments necessarily required in such 
<lb/>like business : out of which, if peraduenture there may seeme any thing wanting, in his iudgement , either to be finishing of 
<lb/>any Booke of that argument, or more fuller descriptions of any Countreys whatsoeuer, very easily, or in deed without any la-
<lb/>bour at all be may see, from whence it may be and by be fetched.
<lb/>	These things they are which I thought good to admonish the Reader of. It remaineth now, that wee doe entreate every 
<lb/>man, to take this our labour and entertaine it, with no other minde then it was by vs both begunne and finished, at the length 
<lb/>set out and Imprinted. Farewell, and wish well to Francis Hogenberg, Ferdinand, and Ambrofe Arfen, by whose skil-
<lb/>full bands and extraordinary great paines and diligence almost all these Mappes were engrauen and cut.
<lb/>	From Antwerp, this present yeere 1570.
