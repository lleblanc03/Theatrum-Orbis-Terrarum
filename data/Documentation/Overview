This digital edition was created through a structured, multi-stage setup process that combined technical 
configuration, IIIF integration, and collaborative editorial work. The project began with establishing a dedicated 
repository using the EditionCrafter React template, which provided the framework for processing IIIF manifests, 
displaying synchronized text and images, and ultimately publishing the edition on GitHub Pages. The repository was 
configured with the necessary GitHub Actions permissions, and a Codespace environment was opened to allow 
contributors to work in a shared  workspace.

Once the infrastructure was set up, the IIIF manifest for the source document was imported and converted into a 
project XML file using the EditionCrafter iiif command. Each page of the source document was assigned to an 
individual student transcriber, who reproduced the text as faithfully as possible. Page images were consulted 
continuously to ensure accuracy, and all expanded abbreviations, uncertain readings, and editorial decisions were 
documented through appropriate TEI tags and attributes. After transcription, the text underwent a collaborative 
verification stage. Transcribers and editors compared the encoded text to the facsimiles, checked for consistency in 
markup, and resolved discrepancies. 

The edition will continue to evolve as new transcriptions are complete and markup is refined. Documentation and 
encoding practices remain living components of the project and will continue to develop under the ongoing guidance 
and editorial supervision of Dr. Bennett, whose continued efforts ensure the accuracy and consistency of the edition.
