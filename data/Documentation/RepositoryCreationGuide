<!--
1. Create Your Repository from the Template
    Go to repository
    Click "Use this template" → "Create a repository"
    On the Create a Repository page
            Include all branches (important)
        Select the Owner (can be yourself)
        Name the repository
        Set visibility to Public
        Click Create Repository
            Your repository will now generate.

2. Update Required GitHub Settings
    Go to Settings
    Click Actions → General
    Ensure the following options are selected
        Action Permissions
            Allow all actions and reusable workflows
        Approval for running fork pull requests
            Require approval for first-time contributors
        Workflow Permissions
            Read and write permissions
            Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests (EXTREMELY important)
        SAVE all settings using the Save buttons.

3. Open a Codespace
    Go back to the Code ( <> ) tab
    Click the green <> Code button
    Under Codespaces, click Create codespace on main
        Wait a minute—your Codespace will load.

4. Make Sure You Are in Bash
    The terminal prompt should look like
        @username ➜ /workspaces/[codespace-name] (main) $

5. Install EditionCrafter Package
    In the terminal, run
        npm install @cu-mkp/editioncrafter
            This installs the EditionCrafter command-line tools required for IIIF and processing.

6. Generate Your IIIF Manifest File
    In the Codespace terminal
        cd data
        ls
        editioncrafter iiif -i [your manifest link] -o [name].xml

        Example
            editioncrafter iiif -i https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:50211907 -o OrteliDocument.xml
   
    Your .xml file (all pages included) will appear inside the data folder.

7. Add Transcriptions
    In the left-hand file tree, right-click data → New Folder
        Name it transcriptions
            Right-click transcriptions → New File…
    File naming rules (IMPORTANT)
        Subtract 1 from the sequence number
            seq. 11 → f010.txt
            seq. 9 → f008.txt
            seq. 20 → f019.txt
                Must match the folio numbers in your XML.
    Paste or type the transcription text into each .txt file.

8. Rebuild the XML Including Transcriptions
    In the terminal
        Press up arrow to recall your previous manifest command
            It will look like
                editioncrafter iiif -i https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/... -o OrteliDocument.xml
            Add the transcription flag
                -t transcriptions

    Full example
        editioncrafter iiif -i https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:50211907 -o OrteliDocument.xml -t transcriptions

    Your .xml file will now contain all transcriptions at the bottom.

9. Update XML Structure
    In the XML file, find
        <text xml:id="text">
    Change it to
        <text xml:id="transcription">
            (Not “transcriptions”. Must be exactly “transcription”.)

10. Configure for Publishing
    Edit astro.config.mjs
        Find
            base '/<BASE_DIR>'
        Replace with your repository name
            Example
                base '/Orteli'
    Edit data/config.json
        Update only the marked lines
            {
                "id" "ec",
                "documentName" "Your Document Name",
                "iiifManifest" "/[repo name]/[xml file name]/iiif/manifest.json",
                "transcriptionTypes" {
                "transcription" "Transcription"
                },
            "viewerUrl" "/[repo name]"
            }

    Example
        {
            "id" "ec",
            "documentName" "Orteli Document",
            "iiifManifest" "/Orteli/test/iiif/manifest.json",
            "transcriptionTypes" {
                "transcription" "Transcription"
            },
        "viewerUrl" "/Orteli"
        }       

11. Process the Edition
    Make sure you're in the root folder, not /data
        cd ..

    Run
        editioncrafter process -i data/[your xml].xml -o public -u [base url]
            How to find the base URL
                Go to Settings → Pages
                Look for “Your site is live at…”
                Copy that link into the command

        Example
            editioncrafter process -i data/TheatrumOrbisTerrarum.xml -o public -u https://lleblanc03.github.io/Theatrum-Orbis-Terrarum/

            A folder named after your .xml file will appear under public, containing
                html/
                iiif/
                tei/
                    If it ends up inside data, something went wrong.

12. Commit and Push the Changes
    Click Source Control (three-circle icon)
        In the message box, type
            Initial Draft
    Click Commit
        If asked about staged changes, click Yes or Always
    Then click Sync Changes
        Approve any pop-ups (OK, don't show again, etc.)

13. Final Deployment
    Go to your GitHub repository
    Click the Actions tab
        Your site should be building (may take 1 or 2 minutes)
    When finished, open pages-build-deployment
    Under deploy, click the link to open your edition
    
    You now have a fully functioning EditionCrafter project live on GitHub Pages
