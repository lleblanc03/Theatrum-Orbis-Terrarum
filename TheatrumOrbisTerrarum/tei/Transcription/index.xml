            <lb/><hi rend="italic">Seeing, that as I thinke, there is no man, gentle Reader, but knoweth what, 
            <lb/>and how great profit the knowledge of Histories doth bring to those which are serious students
            <lb/>therein; I doe verily believe and perswade my selfe, that there is almost no man, be it that he
            <lb/>have made neuer so little an entrance into the same, and touched them neuer so lightly, that is
            <lb/>ignorant how necessary, for the understanding of them aright, the knowledge of </hi>Geogra-
            <lb/>phy<hi rend="italic"> is, which, in that respect therefore is of some, and not without just cause called The eye 
            <lb/>of history. For thou shalt meet with many things in the readings of Histories, (I will not say,
            <lb/>almost all) which, except thou have the knowledge of the countreys and places mentioned in
            <lb/>them, cannot onely not bee well conceived and understood, but also ost-times they are cleane
            <lb/>mistaken and otherwise understood then they ought to bee: which thing commeth to pass in many discourses: but especially
            <lb/>in the expeditions and voyages of great Kings, Captaines and Emperours: in the divers and sundry shirftings of Nations
            <lb/>from one place to another: and in the traveils and peregrinations of famous men, made into sundry countreys. But seeing
            <lb/>that this is a matter which even experience it selfe doeth teach us to be true, there is no reason why I should stand up
            <lb/>on the proofe of the same. This so necessary knowledge of </hi>Geography<hi rend="italic">, as many worthy and learned men have testified,
            <lb/>may very easily be learn'd out of </hi>Geographical charts<hi rend="italic"> or Mappes. And when we have acquainted our selves somewhat
            <lb/>with the use of these </hi>Tables<hi rend="italic"> or Mappes, or have attained thereby to some reasonable knowledge of </hi>Geography<hi rend="italic">
            <lb/>we shall read, these </hi>charts<hi rend="italic"> being placed, as it were certaine glasses before our eye, will the longer be kept in memory, and
            <lb/>make the deeper impression in us: by which means it commeth to pass, that now we do seeme to perceive some fruit of that
            <lb/>which we have read. I omit here, that the reading of </hi>Histories<hi rend="italic"> does both seem to be much more pleasant, and in deed so
            <lb/>it is, when the Mappe being layed before our eyes, we may behold things done, or places where they were done, as if they were
            <lb/>at this time present and in doing. For how much we are holpen, when as in the Holy Scripture, we read of the journey of the
            <lb/> <note type="historical"><!--members of the anchient Hebrew nation.-->Israelites</note>, which they made from </hi><placeName ref="#egypt">Egypt</placeName><hi rend="italic">, through the Red sea, and that same huge Wildernesse, into the land of promise,
            <lb/>when as looking upon the Mappe of </hi><placeName ref="#palestine">Palestina</placeName><hi rend="italic">, we doe almost aswell see it as if we were there, I think any student in Divini-
            <lb/>tie, or that History hath st made trial. Which things being so, how much those which are students and lovers of </hi>Histories<hi rend="italic">
            <lb/>are cornbred, hindred and stayd, yea, &amp; many times, even while they are in their race and continued course, drawne backe, it is
            <lb/>an easie matter to conceive, when either the description of all countreys cannot be gotten, or if they may be gotten, they are dea-
            <lb/>rer then that every mans money will reach and attaine unto especially those that are but poore, or none of the wealthiest.
            <lb/>For there are many that are much delighted with </hi>Geography<hi rend="italic"> or </hi>Chorography<hi rend="italic">, and especially with Mappes or Tables con-
            <lb/>tayning the plots and descriptions of Countreys, such as there are many now adayes extant and every where to be sold: Be
            <lb/>because that either they have not that, that should buy them; or if they have so much as they are worth, yet they will not lay it
            <lb/>out, they neglect them, neither do they any way satisfie themselves. Others there are who when they have that which will buy
            <lb/>them, would very willingly lay out the money, were it not that by reason of the narrownesse of the rooms and places, broad
            <lb/>and large Mappes cannot be opened or spread, that every thing in them may easily and well be seene and discern'd. For, that
            <lb/>I may speake that which is the trueth, those great and large </hi>Geographical<hi rend="italic"> Maps or Charts, which are folded or rowl'd up,
            <lb/>are not so commodious; not when any thing is peraduenture read in them, so easie to be look'd upon. And be that will in or-
            <lb/>der hang them all along upon a wall, had need have not only a very large &amp; wide house, but even a Princess gallery or spacious
            <lb/>Theatre. This I having of unmade trial of, I began to bethinke my selfe, what means might be found to redresse these discom-
            <lb/>modities, which I have spoken of, and either to make them somewhat lesse, or, if possibly might bee, to take them all cleane
            <lb/>away. And at length me thought it might be done by that means which we have obscured and set downe in this our booke, to
            <lb/>which I earnestly with that every student would afford a place in his Library, amongst the rest of his books.
            <lb/>	But that thou mayest the better understand, what it is that we have done in this our Theater, and what it is that thou
            <lb/>must expect and looke for in the same; I thinke it not amisse in few words briefly here to declare unto the. First

        <lb/>my purpose was to represent unto thy view whatsoeuer heretofore thou had'st, or now hast, in any Geographical or Choro-
        <lb/>graphical Chartes here and there lately or long since set out that euer csame to my hands, or were possibly to bee gotten for
        <lb/>loue or money. Of all country's whose descriptions are set out in out in Geographicall Tables, we have selected one (for of some
        <lb/>there are diuers) which in our indgement seemed to bee the best and most exact: Which, notwithstanding that it were, by
        <lb/>the first draught of the Authour somewhat large and broad, we haue brought into that small forme, as might agree with this
        <lb/>our worke, and that the whole Mappe might be contein'd in one leafe: or, which sometime thou shalt obserue we haue done,
        <lb/>as thou may'st see, that in one leafe many might bee contein'd and expressed: yet so as nothing, no neuer so small a thing, is
        <lb/>either omitted or altered that was to bee found in the greater: except it be this, which oftentimes thou shalt finde, that the
        <lb/>names of places and other things, which in the first Copies could hardly be read,in these our Mappes we haue so expressed, that
        <lb/>they may perfectly be read of any man. And sometime, where occasion did serue,or need require,and the place would permit,
        <lb/>unto the modern and usuall names of certaine places, wee haue added the ancient names mentioned by old writers, but now
        <lb/>uulgary unknowne. Which, as we doubt not, we haue done with the good leaue and liking of the Authours themselues:
        <lb/>so I hope it will be a thing very well pleasing to all such as are readers and students of old Histories and Antiquities. In those
        <lb/>Mappes, which haue their Authours names written upon them, we haue, as I laid, altered nothing at all, excepting two or
        <lb/>three of the Marine tracts of the Low-countreys, which the see hath changed since the time that their descriptions
        <lb/>were first set foorth: As for examples sake,in Flaunders,ouer against <placeName ref="#newZeland">Zeland</placeName>,not farre from the towne <placeName ref="#wateruliet">Wateruliet</placeName>, where
        <lb/>by the goodnesse and great benefit of Almighty God, long after that the description of this Countrey was first set out , 
        <lb/>the Maine-land was much enlarged and had gotten an advantage of the Sea: wee there haue altered the forme of that Mappe,
        <lb/>according as the place is found to be at this day. The description of which plot ground we obteined of Master 
            <persName ref="#markLaurine">Marke Lau-
        <lb/>rine</persName>,the Lord and owner, thereof, a braue gentleman, greatlt renowmedboth for the noble stocke from whence hee is descen-
        <lb/>ded, as also for his wisdome and great experience. Eut in other Mappes, which had no name of the Authour subscribed
        <lb/>unto them,we were somewhat more bold : for in these, in some places, at our discretion, where we thought good,wee haue al-
        <lb/>tered some-things, some-things we haue put out, and otherwhere, if it seemed to be necessary,we haue put in. Of some Coun-
        <lb/>treys also,that we might,as much as in us did lye,make up our iust number and fill up our ranke, be haue made some Mappes
        <lb/>of our owne, that there might as few Mappes be wanting, as possibly might be. In the abridgement and bringing of those
        <lb/>Mappes,which had as i said the names of the Authours added unto them,into a letter frome, we haue used that faithfulnesse
        <lb/>and diligence, that we hope to deserue thankes not onely of the Reader, but also euen of the Authours themselues, or at least
        <lb/>we haue dealt so in them , that no man need be asham'd of these of ours whatsoeuer they be; yea he may aswell acknowledge
        <lb/>and take this little one of ours,for his owne , as that first set out by himselfe. For wee have endeuoured to the
        <lb/>uttermost of our power in this our worke, if it were possible, to deserue thankes of the Authours, if not, uet by no meanes to
        <lb/>displease them: Not to follow or imitate that bad custome of some men in these our dayes, who, that they mat seeme to the
        <lb/>world to set fouurth some new thing, does nothing els but alter the workes and labours of other men, and ostentimes, out of those
        <lb/>which are good, to select that which is not good, and to sell it commonly for the best: Sometimes by adding something at their
        <lb/>pleasure, and in some places againe taking out and detracting something, and witball either by concealing the right Authors
        <lb/>names, or setting to their owne, or seyning a name of some one or other, they thinke to please the vulgar sort with nouelties,
        <lb/>that that their worke may sell the better; and they may rake money together they care not how: For we were not mooued to
        <lb/>undertake this labour by any couetous desire of getting much by it, but even of a willing and forward minde that wee had to
        <lb/>helpe and further those that had a love and affection to these studies, not any whit respecting the gayning of any vaine glory
        <lb/>and commendation by other mens labours. For what need we to make new Mappes, when as the old Mappes of other men,
        <lb/>now extant, would serue our turne? Some there are peraduenture, which will looke to finde in this our Theater more de-
        <lb/>scriptions of particular Countreys, (for every man naturally, for the love that he beareth to his native soil, would, I doubt
        <lb/>not, with that it were here seuerally described amongst the rest but let them know, that those which are here missing, are
        <lb/>not left out and omitted, either by our negligence, or for that we were lothe to be at that cost and charges: but because that ei-
        <lb/>ther we never saw any such, or at leastwayes for that there never came any such to our hands. If there be any man, which
        <lb/>either hath any such, or knoweth where there may be had, him we would earnestly entreate, that be would be the meanes to
        <lb/>helpe us unto them, assuredly promising him, that we will, at our owne coft and charges, not without great thankes to him,
        <lb/>and a most honourable mention of his name, cause them to be cut and imprinted apart and by themselves, that hereafter they
        <lb/>may be inserted into this our Booke, either in their owne place, elsewhere, as any man shall like best.
        <lb/>	
        <lb/>Of the Order also by us here obserued in the place of these our Mappes, I thinke it not amisse, gentle Reader, to speake a
        <lb/>word or two, and to acquaint thee with our purpose: that if peraduenture there be any man, which doeth thinke, that
        <lb/>can be looked for at our hands. First of all, we present unto thy view an Vniuersall Mappe of the whole world: Then,
        <lb/>the foure quarters of principall parts of the same; to wit, <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>, <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName>, <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#america">America</placeName>: in this following dame Na-
        <lb/>ture, in which alwayes before the parts can be, the whole, whereof they be the parts, must of
        <lb/>these we have put the seuerall and particular Countreys of these parts, beginning at the West part of the world, in this fol-
        <lb/>lowing <persName ref="#ptomlemey">Ptolemey</persName> the Prince of Geographers, and almost all others that have written of this argument: And so the Pro-
        <lb/>vinces and particular countreys of <placeName ref="#america">America</placeName> do first put foorth and shew themselves: next to these do follow the Brittifh
        <lb/>Iles, after them <placeName ref="#spain">Spaine</placeName>, and then <placeName ref="#france">France</placeName>. From hence we passe to <placeName ref="#germany">Germany</placeName>: whole Countreys being after our maner dili-
        <lb/>gently surueyed, from <placeName ref="#heluetia">Heluetia</placeName> or <placeName ref="#switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> we passed over the Mountaines into <placeName ref="#italy">Italy</placeName>, which is the next countrey unto
        <lb/>it Eastward, purposing also to view all the Provinces thereof seuerally. From thence we croffed the Sea, sayl'd into

        <lb/>skipping none, at last returneth lasely and ioyfully from whence he first set foorth.
        <lb/>   Thus farre of the Mappes themselues: Now let vs speake a word or two of the backside of the same. Because we thought
        <lb/>it would be a thing nothing pleasing to the Reader or Beholder, to see the backsides of the leaues altogether bare and empty;
        <lb/>we determined there to make a certaine briefe and short declaration and Historical discourse of euery Mappe, in the same
        <lb/>manner and order as we said we obserued in the Mappes themselues; omitting nor concealing any mans name, that we had oc-
        <lb/>casion to vse. Moreouer to these also we have added a Table of the names of all the Authors, that euer wee knew or had;
        <lb/>out of which, those that are so disposed, may fetch a more ample and larger <unclear reason="faded">discowse</unclear> and description of the seurall Countreys
        <lb/>handled by them.  Wherefore the students of Geography shall haue here, in the Authours thus named in order, and in the 
        <lb/>Catalogue of the Authours of the Geographicall Tables or Mappes, which we have set before this our worke, and lastly in 
        <lb/>these Tables themselues, a certaine shoppe, as it were, furnished with all kinde of instruments necessarily required in such 
        <lb/>like business : out of which, if peraduenture there may seeme any thing wanting, in his iudgement , either to be finishing of 
        <lb/>any Booke of that argument, or more fuller descriptions of any Countreys whatsoeuer, very easily, or in deed without any la-
        <lb/>bour at all be may see, from whence it may be and by be fetched.
        <lb/>   These things they are which I thought good to admonish the Reader of. It remaineth now, that wee doe entreate every 
        <lb/>man, to take this our labour and entertaine it, with no other minde then it was by vs both begunne and finished, at the length

    <lb/>THIS Map next ensuing containeth and representeth the portraiture of the whole earth,

    <lb/>the Ancients (who were not as then acquainted with the New world, not long since de-

    <lb/>vnder the <placeName ref="#southPole">South pole</placeName>, a fifth, <hi rend="italic"><persName ref="#gerardusMercator">Gerardus Mercator</persName></hi> the Prince of modern Geographers in his
    <lb/>neuer-sufficiently-commended vniuersall Table or Map of the whole world, diuides this
    <lb/>Circumference of the earth into three Continents: the first he calles that, which the Anci-
    <lb/>ents diuided into three parts, and from whence the holy Writ beares record, that mankind had their first origi-
    <lb/>nall, &amp; first was seated: the second, is that which at this present is named <hi rend="italic"><placeName ref="#america">America</placeName></hi> or the <hi rend="italic"><placeName ref="#westIndies">VVest Indies</placeName></hi>: for the third,

    <lb/>In the diuision of the world, diuers haue placed <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> in the third part : some few haue made no more but <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> only ; and <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> they make a part of <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>, saith <persName ref="#salustius">Salustius</persName>. This is that which <persName ref="#stPaulinus">S. Paulinus</persName> in <placeName ref="#aulonius">Aulonius</placeName>, out o
    <lb/> the opinion of the same Saluit, thus writeth of : <foreign xml:lang="la">Europam Afiamque duo vel maxima terrae Membra, quibus Lybiam
    <lb/>dubie Sallustius addit, Europæ admixtram : poffit quum tertia dici</foreign> : <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> and <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> vast, the Earthly globe between 
    <lb/>them share. Yet whether <placeName ref="#africa">Africke</placeName> should a part of this our <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> be ; or make a third part by it selfe, Saluit doth doubt 
    <lb/>I see. But <persName ref="#philostratus">Philostratus</persName> also in <persName ref="#isocrates">Isocrates</persName> doth diuide the world into <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> : yea <persName ref="#isocrates">Isocrates</persName> himself, in his Pane-
    <lb/>gyricos. Moreouer in <persName ref="#varro">Varroes</persName> booke <foreign xml:lang="la">De lingua Latina</foreign> these words are read ; As all the world is diuided into Heaven
    <lb/>and <placeName ref="#earth">Earth</placeName> : so Heaven is seuered into his quarters : and the <placeName ref="#earth">Earth</placeName> into <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>. Againe the same author in his 
    <lb/>booke of Husbandrie writeth thus : first, when as the world, by <persName ref="#eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</persName>, was very fully and naturally divided into 
    <lb/>two parts, the one toward the South, <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> doubtlesse he meaneth the other in the north <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> we call it. <persName ref="#stAugustine">S. Augu-
    <lb/>stine</persName> in his 16. booke <foreign xml:lang="la">De Ciuitate Dei</foreign> : <persName ref="#lucane">Lucane</persName> in his 9. booke: and <persName ref="#orosius">Orosius</persName> in the first booke of his history, haue the like
    <lb/>wordes to the same sense. Notwithstanding custome since hath preuailed with all historiographers and cosmographers which haue written either in Latine 
    <lb/>or Greeke, ioinly to diuide the globe of the earth into these three parts: <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName>, <placeName ref="#africa">Africke</placeName> and <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>: the last of which we have taken vpon vs to describe in 
    <lb/>this place, not only in forme of a mappe or chart, like a Geographer: but in this present discourse, like an historian. Concerning the forme of it therefore, it 
    <lb/>is manifold, as <persName ref="#strabo">Strabo</persName> writeth. It is a Peninsula or demy-isle, and not an island; although <persName ref="#silenus">Silenus</persName>, as <persName ref="#elianus">Elianus</persName> writeth, did sometime to <persName ref="#midas">Midas</persName> so relate of
    <lb/>it. For it is on all sides, as you may see in the mappe, bounded and beaten with the salt sea, but only upon the East, where it is by a small necke ioined to the 
    <lb/>greater <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName>. Yet by what limits they are there distinguished, the ancient and the later writers do not altogether agree. For those which are more ancient 
    <lb/>as <persName ref="#aristotle">Aristotle</persName>, <persName ref="#plato">Plato</persName>, <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName>, and others which do follow their opinion, do diuide <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> from <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName>, by the riuer <placeName ref="#phasis">Phasis</placeName>, (a riuer of Colchis falling 
    <lb/>into the <placeName ref="#euxineSea">Euxine sea</placeName>, <placeName ref="#marMaiore">Mar Maiore</placeName>, or <foreign xml:lang="la">Maurothalassa</foreign>, as the greeks call it) neere <placeName ref="#trapezonda">Trapezonda</placeName> : some mappes do now call that riuer <placeName ref="#fasso">Fasso</placeName>, others <placeName ref="#phazzeth">Phaz-
    <lb/>zeth</placeName>: the Scythians, (as <persName ref="#thevet">Theuet</persName> reporteth, Debbaffethca) or which is all one, by that ithmos or neckland which is between the forefaid <placeName ref="#marMaiore">Mar Maiore</placeName> or 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#pontusEuxinus">Pontus Euxinus</placeName>, and the <placeName ref="#caspianSea">Caspian sea</placeName> (<placeName ref="#marDeCachu">Mar de Cachu</placeName>, the ancient called it <placeName ref="#mareHyrcanum">Mare Hyrcanum</placeName>, the <placeName ref="#hyrcanianSea">Hyrcanie sea</placeName>) which formerly all old writers thought to 
    <lb/>be but a bay or gulfe of the Scythian or Northren ocean, as <persName ref="#strabo">Strabo</persName>, <persName ref="#pliny">Pliny</persName>, <persName ref="#mela">Mela</persName>, <persName ref="#dionysius">Dionysius</persName>, <persName ref="#plutarch">Plutarch</persName> (in the life of <persName ref="#alexander">Alexander</persName> and in his discourse of the 
    <lb/>face in the sphere of the Moone) and <persName ref="#iornandes">Iornandes</persName> a more late writer, have first recorded. Yet all of them were deceiued. Only <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> truly (as this 
    <lb/>our latter age doth approve and find to be so) doth affirme this to be a sea of it selfe, and to have neither in-let nor out-let, or to be intermeddled with any other 
    <lb/>sea. <persName ref="#dionysius">Dionysius</persName>, <persName ref="#arrianus">Arrianus</persName>, <persName ref="#diodorus">Diodorus</persName>, <persName ref="#polybius">Polybius</persName>, <persName ref="#iornandes">Iornandes</persName> and <persName ref="#ptolemy">Ptolemey</persName> have diuided it from <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> by the riuer <placeName ref="#tanais">Tanais</placeName> (<placeName ref="#don">Don</placeName> or <placeName ref="#tana">Tana</placeName>, as now the 
    <lb/>Italians name it) who think that both the rise of this riuer, and the land Northward from where it commeth, are both unknown and uncertaine. All 
    <lb/>doubt where to place and lay their bounds : as indeed who never perfectly knew those places toward the East and North, not being then discovered, but only 
    <lb/>described by them, from the fabulous reports of others: as for example, the <placeName ref="#riphaean">Riphæan</placeName> and <placeName ref="#hyperborean">Hyperboræan</placeName> mountaines, which are fained inventions of the 
    <lb/>Greekes, as <persName ref="#strabo">Strabo</persName> writeth: together with <placeName ref="#aluaniMontes">Aluani montes</placeName>, heere described by <persName ref="#ptolemy">Ptolemey</persName>, where not only these mountaines, but also no other at this 
    <lb/>day, are to be seene: but in their places diuers huge and vast woods, great fennes and bogges, or large champion plaines. <persName ref="#orpheus">Orpheus</persName> also long since described 
    <lb/>in this part of the continent I meane, between <placeName ref="#maeotisPalus">Mæotis palus</placeName>, the <placeName ref="#fenneMaeotis">fenne Mæotis</placeName>, (now called <placeName ref="#marDelleZabbache">Mar delle Zabbache</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#mardellaTana">Mardella Tana</placeName>) and the <placeName ref="#croniumSea">sea
    <lb/>Cronium</placeName>, an huge wood. Likewise, <persName ref="#dionysius">Dionysius</persName> after heereabouts placeth an infinite wood, as he termeth it, from whence he saith <placeName ref="#tanais">Tanais</placeName> or <placeName ref="#don">Don</placeName> doth
    <lb/>spring, which after many windings and turnings at last falleth into the forenamed <placeName ref="#fenneMaeotis">fenne Maeotis</placeName>. <persName ref="#isidorus">Isidorus</persName> heere hath the <placeName ref="#riphaeanWoods">Riphaean woods</placeName>, in which he
    <lb/>saith <placeName ref="#tanais">Tanais</placeName> doth first take the beginning. That <placeName ref="#danube">Donaw</placeName> (Danubis) doth diuide <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> from <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>, <persName ref="#seneca">Seneca</persName> in the sixth booke Naturall doth manifestly
    <lb/>affirm; of which his opinion, what do we thinke, we will, God willing, set downe in the discourse to the Mappe of <placeName ref="#dacia">Dacia</placeName>. Hitherto we see the forenamed au-
    <lb/>thours to doubt and disagree between themselues of the limits of these two parts of the world: if therefore they shall find me a meet vmpier and arbitratour
    <lb/>in this matter, I would, not vnfitly, and as I hope to the liking of all parties, decide the controuer thus: I would make the bounds to be <placeName ref="#tanais">Tanais</placeName>, or the ri-
    <lb/>uer <placeName ref="#don">Don</placeName>; the straits or narrow peece of the maine land that is between the riuer and the <placeName ref="#rha">riuer Rha</placeName> (Athel), which emptyeth it selfe into the <placeName ref="#caspianSea">Caspian sea</placeName>:
    <lb/>the East branch of the same Athel: then from his head vnto the <placeName ref="#oby">riuer Oby</placeName>, and so even vnto his mouth or fall into the <placeName ref="#northSea">Northren sea</placeName>: For by this mouth, I
    <lb/>do easily perswade my selfe, that antiquity did verily beleeue that the <placeName ref="#caspianSea">Caspian sea</placeName> did vnlade it selfe into the maine Ocean. For that the name of this <placeName ref="#oby">riuer O-
    <lb/>by</placeName> is ancient, it is very likely, for that <placeName ref="#montesObij">montes Obij</placeName>, certain mountaines called <placeName ref="#obij">Obij</placeName> are placed heere about in this tract, by <persName ref="#athenaeus">Athenaeus</persName>, which he saith for-
    <lb/>merly were called of the ancient <placeName ref="#montesRiphæi">montes Riphæi</placeName>, the <placeName ref="#riphaeanHills">Riphaean hils</placeName>: but then in his daies <placeName ref="#montesAlpes">montes Alpes</placeName>, the <placeName ref="#alpes">Alpes</placeName>. Againe <persName ref="#iornandes">Iornandes</persName> in this continent,
    <lb/>not farre from hence, describeth Ovim or Obim, a Scythian nation or family. And that these foresaid mountaines are in this place (not where <persName ref="#ptolemy">Ptolemey</persName>
    <lb/>and <persName ref="#pomponiusMela">Pomponius Mela</persName> haue placed them) very many men of great credit and learning in these our daies, sufficient witnesses do stoutly auouch. Amongst
    <lb/>which <persName ref="#herberstein">Baro Herberstein</persName>, in his history of <placeName ref="#moscovy">Moscouy</placeName>, is one: <persName ref="#paulOderborne">Paul Oderborne</persName>, in his treatise written of the life of <persName ref="#basilides">Bafilides</persName>, is another: lastly, <persName ref="#antonyWied">Antony
    <lb/>Wied</persName>, in his mappe of <placeName ref="#moscovy">Moscouy</placeName> may be the third. Now they name it vulgarly by diuers and sundrie names, but commonly they call it <placeName ref="#cingulumMundi">Cingulum mundi</placeName>,
    <lb/>The girdle of the world, as the said <persName ref="#herberstein">Herberstein</persName> doth affirme. In a mappe of these countries set out by <persName ref="#jenkinson">Master Jenkinson</persName>, an Englishman, who travelled
    <lb/>through these parts, it is called <placeName ref="#zonaOrbis">Zona Orbis</placeName>, The girdle of the Earth. Moreouer I haue in some sort for this diuision, <persName ref="#iornandes">Iornandes</persName> and <persName ref="#aethicus">AEthicus</persName>, upon my 
    <lb/>side, where they say that the <placeName ref="#ripheanMontes">Riphean mountaines</placeName> do part <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>. Againe these selfe same hils, yea, and in this tract, are the <placeName ref="#montesHyperborei">montes Hyperbo-
    <lb/>rei</placeName>; not where <persName ref="#ptolemy">Ptolemey</persName> placeth them. And they are the same with montes <placeName ref="#riphæi">Riphæi</placeName>, <placeName ref="#obij">Obij</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#alpes">Alpes</placeName>. Thus farre of the diusion of <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> from <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>.
</p>
<lb/>
<p>
    <persName ref="#pliny">     Pliny</persName> calleth this part of the world, The Nurce of all Nations; <persName ref="#mardonius">Mardonius</persName>, as <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> doth tell of him, auoucheth it to <persName ref="#xerxes">Xerxes</persName>, to be by farre 
    <lb/>the beautifulleft of all places of the World, to be a most goodly and gallant country, yielding all maner of fruits and fruitfull trees and those
    <lb/>in their kindes and best; and to be such that it were pity that any king in the World should haue ought to do in but he. <persName ref="#varro">Varro</persName> in his bo kes <foreign xml:lang="la">Dere 
    <lb/>Rustica</foreign>, of Husbandrie writeth, That it is a more temperate and healthful soile than <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName>. <persName ref="#statius">Statius</persName> in his Achilleidos, more than once or twice, calleth
    <lb/>it, The Mighty prouince of the World. <foreign xml:lang="la">Maximaterra viris &amp; fœcundissima doctis Vrbibus</foreign>, <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> for multitude of warlike men and scholers 
    <lb/>deeply learned, doth farre excell thus <persName ref="#mamilius">Mamilius</persName> writeth of it. <persName ref="#aristotle">Aristotle</persName>, the prince of Philospophers, maketh the inhabiters of this part of the world, to be, 
    <lb/>A very stout and couragious people. The same authour affirmeth, that, All kind of beasts and cattell heere, are in their kind, greater, and stronger 
    <lb/>than in <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> and <placeName ref="#africa">Africke</placeName>. But of the nature of this country, the maners and customes of the people, let vs heare what <persName ref="#strabo">Strabo</persName> that excellent Geographer saith
    <lb/>in his second book ; This part is most fertile of valiant and prudent men. It is all generally habitable, excepting only a very small portion toward 
    <lb/>the North, and abutting vpon the Hamaxici, which dwell vpon <placeName ref="#tanais">Tanais</placeName>, <placeName ref="#don">Don</placeName> Meo'is Palus (<placeName ref="#marDelleZabbache">Mar delle Zabacche</placeName>) and <placeName ref="#borysthenes">Borysthenes</placeName> (<placeName ref="#nieper">Nieper</placeName> or
    <lb/><placeName ref="#dnester">Dnester</placeName>) which place, by reason of the extream cold, is not habitable. Yet certaine bleake and mountainous places inhabited, although in re-
    <lb/>spect of the nature of the soile they are tilled and manured with greater difficulty, yet having gotten good skilull and industrious husbands,
    <lb/>those also are tamed and much bettered, which heeretofore were badly vsed, and kept only by theeues and out-lawes. And indeed the Greekes
    <lb/>when they dwelt vpon the rocks and mountaines, dwelt well and conueniently, by reason of their wise cariage in ciuill matters, arts, sciences and 
    <lb/>knowledge of those things, which necessarily are required to the maintenance of mans life. In like maner the Romanes, hauing brought many 
    <lb/>sauage and fierce Nations vnder their seruile yoke, seated, I meane, in places not very conuenient to dwell in, in respect of the nature of the coun- 
    <lb/>try, either for that it was rough and craggy, or wanted hauens, or was too bleake and cold, or for other causes, taught them to vse merchandise
    <lb/>before vnknowen, and haue brought them from a sauage and brutish life, to live ciuilly and more humanely. But those parts which are situate in
    <lb/>an equall and temperat climate, there nature administreth all things necessary for the maintenance of man and beast. Now when as those Nations
    <lb/>which do inhabite and dwell in fertile and rich countries, are maintainers of peace and quietnesse ; and those which are seated in barren and vn-
    <lb/>fruitfull countries, are most hardy and stout : it commeth to passe that both are helpfull one to another ; while these do vse their weapons for 
    <lb/>their countries defence, those againe do help and maintaine them by the profits that they raise out of the earth, by their arts and mysteries, as also
    <lb/>by their learning, wisedome and policy : euen as in like maner also the dammage is mutuall and either side feeleth a sensible hurt, when the one
    <lb/>part doth not helpe the other : yet the estate of the souldier and warlike man is somewhat better, if they be not ouercome with multitude. And
    <lb/>the nature of <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> serueth very fitly for this purpose : for it is all diuersly distinguished by lofty mountaines and lowly plaines ; so that euery
    <lb/>where the husbandmen and soldiers ; the politicians and the martiall warriers do dwell together : yet so as the greatest number are peaceable
    <lb/>men : which kind of life they enjoy especially by the meanes and labour of their captaines, first of the Greekes, then of the Macedonians, and
    <lb/>lastly of the Romanes. Therefore both in peace and warre it is sufficient of itselfe to maintaine and defend itselfe : for it hath great plenty both
    <lb/>of stout soldiers, painfull husbandmen, and politique statesmen. In this also it doth excel, that it bringeth foorth passing good fruits, such I
    <lb/>meane, as are necessary for the maintenance of mans life: with all sorts of mettall, for what vse soeuer. Spices or sweet smelling things and preti- 
    <lb/>ous stones, are brought hither from forren countries, WHICH THINGS WHOSOEVER HAVE NOT, THEY LIVE NEVER A WHIT 
    <lb/>WORSE THAN THOSE DO THAT HAVE THEM. Moreouer this is especially worth the noting, that hauing wonderfull store of cattell, 
    <lb/>sheep and oxen ; it breedeth very few dangerous wild beasts. Thus farre the learned <persName ref="#strabo">Strabo</persName>. Many other things thou maist read of this <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>,
    <lb/>together with the nature and condition of the people of the same, in that treatise which <persName ref="#hippocrates">Hippocrates</persName>, the prince of Physitions, wrote of the aire and waters.
    <lb/>This <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName> also, and not any other place of the world beside, doth yeeld Succinum or Electrum, (Amber we call it, the Germanes, Glessum) yet it is not 
    <lb/>found in <placeName ref="#eridianus">Eridianus</placeName>, a river falling into some Northren sea, as <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> doth fabulously report : or in <placeName ref="#padus">Padus</placeName>, a riuer of Italy (Po) as the poets iestingly af-
    <lb/>firme: nor in the Electrides, certaine fained ilands in the <placeName ref="#hadriatic">Hadriaticke sea</placeName>, as some men of better credit, and more diligent searchers out of the <supplied reason="illegible">t</supplied>ruth, as <persName ref="#pliny">Pliny</persName>

<lb/>
<lb/>This part the ancient Geographers, as <persName ref="#strabo">Strabo</persName> in his eleuenth booke, and <persName ref="#arrianus">Ar-

<lb/>fitly be distributed into fine parts, according to the great Empires by which it is gouerned. The first
<lb/>whereof, which bordereth upon <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>, and is subiect to the great <persName ref="#dukeMoscovia">Duke of Mofcouia</persName>, is bounded
<lb/>by the Frozen sea, the riuer <placeName ref="#ob">Ob</placeName>, the lake <placeName ref="#kitaia">Kitaia</placeName>, and a line drawen from thence to the <placeName ref="#caspianSea">Caspian sea</placeName>,
<lb/>and by the Isthmus or neck-land between the <placeName ref="#caspianSea">Caspian</placeName> and <placeName ref="#euxinSea">Euxin seas</placeName>. The second is that, which
<lb/>yields obedience to the great <persName ref="#greatCham">Cham Emperour</persName> of the <placeName ref="#tartars">Tartars</placeName>, whole Southern borders are the <placeName ref="#caspianSea">Caspi-

<lb/>and Westward it confines vpon the dominions of the foresaid great <persName ref="#dukeRussia">Duke of Russia</persName>. The third part,

<lb/>whom the Persian for the most part manteineth continuall warres; Northward the Empire of the
<lb/><persName ref="#greatCham">great Cham</persName>; Eastward it extends almost to the riuer <placeName ref="#indus">Indus</placeName>; and on the south it is restrained by the

<lb/>sift part takes vp all that remaineth, which as in times past, so at this present, is called <placeName ref="#theIndies">The Indies</placeName>;
<lb/>neither is it gouerned by one only, as the former; but by many pety Kings, euery region almost hauing
<lb/>a peculiar Gouernour, some which are tributarie to the <persName ref="#greatCham">great Cham</persName>. And here it is not to be omitted,
<lb/>that all the sea-coasts from the <placeName ref="#arabianGulf">Arabian gulfe</placeName>, to the <placeName ref="#promontoryChina">Promontory of China</placeName>, commonly called <placeName ref="#caboDeLampo">Cabo
<lb/>de Lampo</placeName>, situate in 30. degrees of Northerly latitude, are in a maner possessed, or made tributary

<lb/>but this last, whether it be an island, or adioyned to the <placeName ref="#southMaine">South maine</placeName>, it is not yet Certainly knowen.
<lb/>
<lb/>The memorie of this part of the world is most renowmed, not only with prophane authors (as they 
<lb/>terme them) in regard of the first monarchies established by the Assyrians, the Persians, the Babylo-
<lb/>nians, and the Medes; but in the holy Scriptures also it is more famous than the rest: for here man-
<lb/>kinde was not only created by almightie God, deluded and corrupted by the enemie Satan, and resto-
<lb/>red by our Saviour Christ; but we finde almost all the hestories in either Testament to haue beene in
<lb/>this part both written and accomplished.
<lb/><persName ref="#strabo">Strabo</persName> hath described Asia in six books, namely from the 11. booke vnto the 16. <persName ref="#ptolemy">Ptolomey</persName> hath
<lb/>decyphered the fame in three, as in his 5. 6. And 7. books; and likewise in 12. Geographicall Tables,
<lb/>and ascribes unto it 40. prouinces. It is also let foorth by <persName ref="#ammianusMarcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</persName> in his 23.
<lb/>booke, and by <persName ref="#diodorusSiculus">Diodorus Siculus</persName> in the beginning of his 18. Of late Writers none haue wholly and

<lb/>(but this Authour is fraught with fables) haue written so much thereof, as by trauelling the regions,
<lb/>they found worthie of obseruation. Reade also the Epistle of <persName ref="#iacobusNauarca">Iacobus Nauarca</persName> a Fesuite.
<lb/>        I my selfe likewise certaine yeeres past set forth a large Map the description of the same.

    <lb/>This the Ancients have diuersly distinguished; but at this present it is divided by <persName ref="#johnLeo">John Leo</persName> of

    <lb/>which is accounted the best, they circumscribe with the <placeName ref="#atlanticSea">Atlantick</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean seas</placeName>; with 
    <lb/>mount <placeName ref="#atlas">Atlas</placeName>, &amp; whither region of <placeName ref="#barca">Barca</placeName> bordering upon <placeName ref="#egypt">Ægypt</placeName>. <placeName ref="#numidia">Numidia</placeName>, called by the 
    <lb/>inhabitants Biledulgerid, and abounding with Dates (for which cause the Arabians call it by no 
    <lb/>other name, but the Date-bearing region) is bounded Westward by the <placeName ref="#atlantickOcean">Atlantick Ocean</placeName>; 
    <lb/>Northward by mount <placeName ref="#atlas">Atlas</placeName>; it stretcheth East as farre as the citie <placeName ref="#caphsa">Caphsa</placeName>, which is an hundred &amp; 
    <lb/>fiftie miles distant from <placeName ref="#egypt">Ægypt</placeName>; and the sande <placeName ref="#desertsLibya">Deserts of Libya</placeName> embrace it on the South. <placeName ref="#libya">Libya</placeName>
    <lb/>the third part, is named in the Arabian tongue <placeName ref="#sura">Sura</placeName>, which word signifies a Desert. It begins East 
    <lb/>from <placeName ref="#nilus">Nilus</placeName>, and thence runneth West as farre as the <placeName ref="#atlantickSea">Atlantick sea</placeName>; <placeName ref="#numidia">Numidia</placeName> lies to the North of it, 
    <lb/>and the Land of Negros to the South. Now followeth the fourth part, which they call <placeName ref="#nigritania">Nigritarum</placeName> or 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#nigritania">Nigritania</placeName>, either from the inhabitants, who are of a blacke colour, or from the <placeName ref="#niger">river Niger</placeName>, that 
    <lb/>runneth thorow the countrey. It is bounded by <placeName ref="#libya">Libya</placeName>, South by the <placeName ref="#aethiopicOcean">Æthiopick Ocean</placeName>; West by 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#guinee">Guinee</placeName>, and East by the <placeName ref="#kingdomGago">Kingdome of Gago</placeName>. And here we are to note, that according unto their 
    <lb/>division, all <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> is included within the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean</placeName>, <placeName ref="#atlantickSea">Atlantick</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#aethiopicOcean">Æthiopick</placeName> seas and the 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#nilus">river Nilus</placeName>; whereof <placeName ref="#egypt">Ægypt</placeName> and <placeName ref="#abassia">Abassia</placeName> are accounted parts of it, which we not unworthily 
    <lb/>therefore proper to belong to <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>. For the true <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> containes at this day <persName ref="#presterJohn">Prester Johns</persName> 
    <lb/>Empire, which by all late Writers is ascribed to <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>. Wherefore with <persName ref="#ptolemy">Ptolomy</persName> indeed it ought to 
    <lb/>be bound by the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean sea</placeName> and Ocean seas, rather than by any river whatsoever; and 
    <lb/>it hath the forme of a Peninsula, being joined toward <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> by an Isthmos of small neck-land, 
    <lb/>which lies between the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean sea</placeName> and the <placeName ref="#gulfArabia">gulf of Arabia</placeName>. The South part hereof was 
    <lb/>unknowne to our ancestors, till the yeere <date when="1497">1497</date>, whereas <persName ref="#vascoDeGama">Vasco de Gama</persName> first doubling the <placeName ref="#capeBonaSperanza">Cape 
    <lb/>of Bona Speranza</placeName>, and passing about all <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, came to <placeName ref="#calecut">Calecut</placeName> in <placeName ref="#eastIndia">East India</placeName>. This Southerne 
    <lb/>part by the Persians and Arabians is called <placeName ref="#zangibar">Zangibar</placeName>.
    <lb/>At the fore-sayd Cape of good hope the inhabitants are exceeding blacke; which we thought in 
    <lb/>no wise to omit, because all men suppose the cause of blacknesse to be heat, and the 
    <lb/>nearnesse of the Sunne; whereas the Sunne of it selfe forceth no more, than about the Streight 
    <lb/>of Magellan (we measure the heat of the place, according to the position of the heavens and 
    <lb/>distance from the Equinoctiall line) were now notwithstanding the people are reported to be 
    <lb/>marvellous white. But if we will needs ascribe this blacknesse to the scorching of the Sun, let us 
    <lb/>consider, that the same makes the Spaniards and Italians looke white; whereas they are equally 
    <lb/>distant from the Equinoctiall with the inhabitants of the fore-sayd Cape; namely the one towards 
    <lb/>the South, and the other towards the North. <persName ref="#presterJohn">Prester Johns</persName> people are of a browne colour; in 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#zanel">Zanel</placeName> and <placeName ref="#mollala">Mollala</placeName> the inhabitants are cole blacke, yet all in one &amp; the same distance from the 
    <lb/>equator, and under the very same parallell of the heavens. And on the contrary, why did 
    <lb/><persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> and <persName ref="#pindarus">Pindarus</persName> describe such as inhabite the same climate with themselves, namely 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#colchis">Colches</placeName>, to be a blacke people, and curled haired? <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> in his Thalia makes the Indians 
    <lb/>blacke like the Æthiopians; which the experience of our times confirmeth. I know <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> will 
    <lb/>have the cause hereof to be the seede of the parents, which he sayth is not whiter, than of other 
    <lb/>people, but blacke. To whom <persName ref="#possidonius">Possidonius</persName> also subscribeth, and imputeth the matter of all this 
    <lb/>blacknesse unto Canicular heate, against which opinion I have nothing to allege. Let the truth of 
    <lb/>the matter rest upon the authors credit. But this as many men thinke more strange; that in all 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#america">America</placeName> there were no black people found besides a few only in one place called by them 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#quarequa">Quarequa</placeName>. What then is the efficient cause of this colour? Is it the drinesse of the heavens, or of 
    <lb/>the earth? is it perhaps some hidden propriety of the soile? Or a kind of fat licentious nature in 
    <lb/>the nature of men? Or is it all these variances in one? But these things we leave to be 
    <lb/>considered by them, who more curiously search into the secrets of nature.
    <lb/>This portion of the world is called by the Greeks <placeName ref="#libya">Libya</placeName>, and by the Latines <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, because it is 
    <lb/>not moistened with extremity of cold: or (if we may credit some) of <persName ref="#afer">Afer</persName> one of the adventurers 
    <lb/>posterity. Another derivation of the name you have (set downe by <persName ref="#johnLeo">John Leo</persName> in the description of 
    <lb/>his booke of the Description of <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>), who deriveth it from one blacke African, springing of the 
    <lb/>stocke of <persName ref="#cham">Cham</persName>, who first inhabited that part of the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean sea</placeName>, from <placeName ref="#atlas">Atlas</placeName>, bounded by 
    <lb/>the <placeName ref="#nilus">river Nilus</placeName>, or rather as the best authors have taught us, the African soile called of the 
    <lb/>Greekes <placeName ref="#aphrice">Aphrice</placeName>, <placeName ref="#mareRubrum">Marce rubrum</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#redSea">red sea</placeName>. <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> reporteth, that <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> was first 
    <lb/>unknowne till <persName ref="#caesar">Cesars</persName> time, when it was found to be a third part of the inhabited world. <persName ref="#plinie">Plinie</persName> the 
    <lb/>like, and so doth <persName ref="#solinus">Solinus</persName>. <persName ref="#caesarScaliger">Caesar Scaliger</persName> gathereth of the word <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, that it is a name of the 
    <lb/>same import with aprica, that is, a sunne-shining place; for that this land lying open on every 
    <lb/>side to the Sunnes visitation, seemed thereby to have beene named so little other than of 
    <lb/>apricity. The principall regions of <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> have amongst themselves (as it were) a threefold

<lb/>This Prouince was about the yeere <date when="1518">1518</date> forcibly subdued to the
<lb/>Spanish gouernment, vnder the command and conduct of <persName ref="#corlez">Fer-
<lb/>nando Corlez</persName>: who with the great slaughter of his owne people,
<lb/>but farre greater of the inhabitants fighting for their liberty, con-
<lb/>quered the fame. It is a region rich of siluer and golde: for it
<lb/>hath very many riuers yeelding sands or graines of perfect gold.
<lb/>Vpon the coast of this countrey are many commodious fishings for pearle. Salt
<lb/>lakes here are diuers, the water whereof through the heat of the Sunne is conuer-
<lb/>ted into excellent salt. Here is great abundance of <hi rend="fiftula">Cassia fiftula</hi>, and a kind of fruit in
<lb/>the Mexican language called <hi rend="italic">Cacao</hi>, somewhat resembling an Almond: which is
<lb/>with them very highly esteemed; for hereof they make a kinde of drinke, to their
<lb/>owne taste most delicate. The seas and riuers belonging to this countrey abound
<lb/>mightily with fish. Their riuers also breed Crocodiles, whose flesh is food to the
<lb/>inhabitants. In these places this creature is for the most part aboue twenty foot
<lb/>long. It is a countrey very mountainous and beset here and there with most lofty
<lb/>and cragged rocks. So great is the diuersity of languages in these regions, that one
<lb/>cannot vnderstand another without an Interpreter. The principall Colonies to
<lb/>be seene in this Table, which in <placeName ref="#spain">New Spaine</placeName> haue been planted by the Spaniards, 
<lb/>are first <placeName ref="#compostella">Compostella</placeName>, the feat of a bishop, and one of the Kings counsels. <placeName ref="#colima">Colima</placeName>, 
<lb/>by another name called the city of the Purification. <placeName ref="#guadalajara">Guadalajara</placeName>, a towne most fa-
<lb/>mous, and head of the Kingdome of <placeName ref="#gallicia">New Gallicia</placeName>. <placeName ref="#mecboacan">Mecboacan</placeName>, a Bishops sea also.
<lb/><placeName ref="#sacatula">Sacatula</placeName>, the city of the Angels, a mother-towne and a Bishoprick. <placeName ref="#mexico">Mexico</placeName>, a Kingly
<lb/>city, or rather Queene of all the cities in the New world; situate vpon the banke
<lb/>of a lake, or rather of a fenne: yea the very ground-plot of this city is so fenny, that
<lb/>you cannot come thither, nor depart thence but ouer bridges and cawseys. The 
<lb/>lake adioyning is falt, being six leagues long and fiue broad. Fishes it hath none,
<lb/>but very small ones; which more aptly may be called wormes than fishes: of
<lb/>whose putrefaction, which is there caused by the heat of the Summer, the aire is some-
<lb/>times so infected, that it is most vnholesome dwelling there: yet is it as much fre-
<lb/>quented with inhabitants and merchants, as any mart-towne in <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>. It is a large 
<lb/>city, for in compasse it containeth about three leagues. The other lake adioining 
<lb/>to this, is fresh water, and very plentifull of fish; wherein also stand many townes.
<lb/>There are likewise a great number vpon the banks of either lake. In this city (as
<lb/><persName ref="#giraua">Ierome Giraua</persName> reporteth) there was by <persName ref="#paul">Pope Paul</persName> the third established the feat of 
<lb/>an Archbishop, in the yeere <date when="1547">1547</date>. 
<lb/>This citie was taken by the Spaniards 140 yeeres after the first foundation
<lb/>thereof; <persName ref="#montezuma">Montezuma</persName> at the same time being King, the ninth in number. A won-
<lb/>der, how in so few yeeres it should grow to such largenesse and magnificence.
<lb/>The nature, situation, and customes of this citie and of the territory adiacent, who
<lb/>desires more perfectly to know, may reade the relations of <persName ref="#corlez">Fernando Corlez</persName>. Ex-
<lb/>tant they are in the volume intituled <hi rend="italic">Nouus Orbis</hi>; and in the volume of Nauiga-
<lb/>tions printed at <placeName ref="#venice">Venice</placeName> in Italian: but especially <persName ref="#Gonsaluo">John Gonsaluo </persName>, who in his little
<lb/>booke of <placeName ref="#china">China</placeName> hath a most large description of this region. You haue also many
<lb/>notable discourses hereof in the third Volume of <persName ref="#Hakluyts">M. Hakluyts  </persName> English voyages.

<lb/>THis Prouince of <placeName ref="#culiacán">CVLIACAN</placeName> is part of the kingdome of <placeName ref="#newGalicia">New Galicia</placeName>. It was discouered
<lb/>vnder the gouernment of Charles the fifth, in the year <date when="1530">1530</date>. In this region is one only colonie
<lb/>of Spaniards called, The towne of <placeName ref="#s.Micheal.Villages">S. Michael. Villages</placeName> here are very many, bujlt by the
<lb/>inhabitants; all which before the Spaniards arriuall were at their own libertie: yeelding obedience
<lb/>to no King or Gouernour. The region is indifferently furnished with things necessary. Out of the
<lb/>mountaines is digged great abundance of siluer. The inhabitants are addicted to war and robbery.
<lb/>They that dwell vpon the coast, employ most of their time in fishing; but the vplandish people
<lb/>liue by hunting. They goe naked, couering only their priuities with a piece of Cotton. They haue
<lb/>many languages. They lodge for the most part in the open air. They are the most beggerly nation
<lb/>
<lb/><figure rend="middle-top"><figDesc><head><placeName ref="#cuba">CVBA</placeName> and <placeName ref="#hispaniola">HISPANIOLA</placeName></head></figDesc></figure>
<lb/>THis Island of <placeName ref="#cuba">Cuba</placeName> is so called by the naturall inhabitants; but by the Spaniards <placeName ref="#fernandina">Fernandina</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName ref="#jonna">Joanna</placeName>; and (as <persName ref="#peterMartyr">Peter Martyr</persName> reports) Alpha and Omega. In length it extendeth East and
<lb/>West 300 Spanish leagues. The land is very mountainous, but rich of gold, and excellent copper.
<lb/>Madder, which the Apothecaries, because it is very apt to die wooll and leather, call Diers
<lb/>madder, is heere found in great abundance. It is in all places beautified with thicke woods, with
<lb/>riuers and pooles of fresh water : albeit there are lakes naturally salt. The woods breed vp
<lb/>Hogges and Kine in great plentie : the riuers sometimes yeeld grains of gold. It contains fix
<lb/>colonie or townes of Spaniards : the principall whereof called <placeName ref="#santJago">Sant Jago</placeName>, is the feat of a Bishop.
<lb/>But <placeName ref="#hauana">Hauana</placeName> is the chiefe mart and hauen towne of all the Isle. Two wonderfull things
<lb/><persName ref="#gousaluoDeOuiedo">Gousaluo de Ouiedo</persName> describes in this Isle : one, a valley extended betweene two mountaines
<lb/>some three Spanish miles in length : (the Ancients would haue named it, as in <placeName ref="#galliaNarbonenst">Gallia
<lb/>Narbonenst</placeName>, the now called <placeName ref="#prouence">Prouence</placeName>, The stony field) which bringeth forth round stones in so
<lb/>great abundance, that a man may lade whole shippes with them, being by nature framed so
<lb/>exactly round, that no Turner can amend them. The other is a mountaine not farre from the sea,
<lb/>whereout issueth a kind of Bitumen or Pitch in so great a quantity, that it runnes into the sea, and
<lb/>there floats farre and wide, according as it is carried by the waues or windes. This Pitch, they say,
<lb/>is very commodious for the calcking and braying of ships. <placeName ref="#hispaniola">HISPANIOLA</placeName> lies to the East of
<lb/><placeName ref="#cuba">Cuba</placeName>. This Isle by the first inhabitants was called <placeName ref="#quisqueya">Quisqueya</placeName>, afterwards <placeName ref="#haiti">Haiti</placeName> and
<lb/><placeName ref="#cipanga">Cipanga</placeName> likewise. But the Spaniards name it <placeName ref="#hispaniola">Hispaniola</placeName>, and (of the principall city)
<lb/><placeName ref="#sanDomingo">San Domingo</placeName>. The compasle here of is; 50 leagues. It is an Isle rich in Sugar, and it hath many Gold
<lb/>mines. It is very strange that is reported concerning a little flie very common in this Island, called
<lb/>by the inhabitants <placeName ref="#cucuyo">Cucuyo</placeName>, and as big almost as one of the ioynts of a mans finger, hauing foure
<lb/>wings, two very thin, and the other two greater and harder, wherewith the thin ones are couered.
<lb/>This shineth in the night as glowe-wormes doe with vs. The force of this light is not only in his
<lb/>eyes, sparckling like fire, but also in his sides, so that by lifting vp his wings, he shines more
<lb/>flying, than when he lies still. By the naturall curtesie of this little creature, all their chambers,
<lb/>they say, are so lightsome euen in the darkest nights, that a man may reade and write very plainly
<lb/>without the helpe of any other light. This light of theirs is augmented by their number ; so that
<lb/>many will giue a greater light than a few. Whoso deires a larger description of these Islands, let
<lb/>him reade the history of the New world written by <persName ref="#jeromeBenzo">Jerome Benzo</persName>, <persName ref="#peterMartyr">Peter Martyr</persName> his Decads of
<lb/>Islands lately discouered, and other writers of <placeName ref="#america">America</placeName>.
