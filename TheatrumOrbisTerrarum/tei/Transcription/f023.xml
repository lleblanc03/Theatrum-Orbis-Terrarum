    <lb/>This the Ancients have diuersly distinguished; but at this present it is divided by <persName ref="#johnLeo">John Leo</persName> of
    <lb/> <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, into foure chiefe parts; <placeName ref="#barbaria">Barbaria</placeName>, <placeName ref="#numidia">Numidia</placeName>, <placeName ref="#libya">Libya</placeName>, and the Land of Negros. <placeName ref="#barbaria">Barbarie</placeName>, 
    <lb/>which is accounted the best, they circumscribe with the <placeName ref="#atlanticSea">Atlantick</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean seas</placeName>; with 
    <lb/>mount <placeName ref="#atlas">Atlas</placeName>, &amp; whither region of <placeName ref="#barca">Barca</placeName> bordering upon <placeName ref="#egypt">Ægypt</placeName>. <placeName ref="#numidia">Numidia</placeName>, called by the 
    <lb/>inhabitants Biledulgerid, and abounding with Dates (for which cause the Arabians call it by no 
    <lb/>other name, but the Date-bearing region) is bounded Westward by the <placeName ref="#atlantickOcean">Atlantick Ocean</placeName>; 
    <lb/>Northward by mount <placeName ref="#atlas">Atlas</placeName>; it stretcheth East as farre as the citie <placeName ref="#caphsa">Caphsa</placeName>, which is an hundred &amp; 
    <lb/>fiftie miles distant from <placeName ref="#egypt">Ægypt</placeName>; and the sande <placeName ref="#desertsLibya">Deserts of Libya</placeName> embrace it on the South. <placeName ref="#libya">Libya</placeName>
    <lb/>the third part, is named in the Arabian tongue <placeName ref="#sura">Sura</placeName>, which word signifies a Desert. It begins East 
    <lb/>from <placeName ref="#nilus">Nilus</placeName>, and thence runneth West as farre as the <placeName ref="#atlantickSea">Atlantick sea</placeName>; <placeName ref="#numidia">Numidia</placeName> lies to the North of it, 
    <lb/>and the Land of Negros to the South. Now followeth the fourth part, which they call <placeName ref="#nigritania">Nigritarum</placeName> or 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#nigritania">Nigritania</placeName>, either from the inhabitants, who are of a blacke colour, or from the <placeName ref="#niger">river Niger</placeName>, that 
    <lb/>runneth thorow the countrey. It is bounded by <placeName ref="#libya">Libya</placeName>, South by the <placeName ref="#aethiopicOcean">Æthiopick Ocean</placeName>; West by 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#guinee">Guinee</placeName>, and East by the <placeName ref="#kingdomGago">Kingdome of Gago</placeName>. And here we are to note, that according unto their 
    <lb/>division, all <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> is included within the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean</placeName>, <placeName ref="#atlantickSea">Atlantick</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#aethiopicOcean">Æthiopick</placeName> seas and the 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#nilus">river Nilus</placeName>; whereof <placeName ref="#egypt">Ægypt</placeName> and <placeName ref="#abassia">Abassia</placeName> are accounted parts of it, which we not unworthily 
    <lb/>therefore proper to belong to <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>. For the true <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> containes at this day <persName ref="#presterJohn">Prester Johns</persName> 
    <lb/>Empire, which by all late Writers is ascribed to <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>. Wherefore with <persName ref="#ptolemy">Ptolomy</persName> indeed it ought to 
    <lb/>be bound by the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean sea</placeName> and Ocean seas, rather than by any river whatsoever; and 
    <lb/>it hath the forme of a Peninsula, being joined toward <placeName ref="#asia">Asia</placeName> by an Isthmos of small neck-land, 
    <lb/>which lies between the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean sea</placeName> and the <placeName ref="#gulfArabia">gulf of Arabia</placeName>. The South part hereof was 
    <lb/>unknowne to our ancestors, till the yeere <date when="1497">1497</date>, whereas <persName ref="#vascoDeGama">Vasco de Gama</persName> first doubling the <placeName ref="#capeBonaSperanza">Cape 
    <lb/>of Bona Speranza</placeName>, and passing about all <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, came to <placeName ref="#calecut">Calecut</placeName> in <placeName ref="#eastIndia">East India</placeName>. This Southerne 
    <lb/>part by the Persians and Arabians is called <placeName ref="#zangibar">Zangibar</placeName>.
    <lb/>At the fore-sayd Cape of good hope the inhabitants are exceeding blacke; which we thought in 
    <lb/>no wise to omit, because all men suppose the cause of blacknesse to be heat, and the 
    <lb/>nearnesse of the Sunne; whereas the Sunne of it selfe forceth no more, than about the Streight 
    <lb/>of Magellan (we measure the heat of the place, according to the position of the heavens and 
    <lb/>distance from the Equinoctiall line) were now notwithstanding the people are reported to be 
    <lb/>marvellous white. But if we will needs ascribe this blacknesse to the scorching of the Sun, let us 
    <lb/>consider, that the same makes the Spaniards and Italians looke white; whereas they are equally 
    <lb/>distant from the Equinoctiall with the inhabitants of the fore-sayd Cape; namely the one towards 
    <lb/>the South, and the other towards the North. <persName ref="#presterJohn">Prester Johns</persName> people are of a browne colour; in 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#zanel">Zanel</placeName> and <placeName ref="#mollala">Mollala</placeName> the inhabitants are cole blacke, yet all in one &amp; the same distance from the 
    <lb/>equator, and under the very same parallell of the heavens. And on the contrary, why did 
    <lb/><persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> and <persName ref="#pindarus">Pindarus</persName> describe such as inhabite the same climate with themselves, namely 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#colchis">Colches</placeName>, to be a blacke people, and curled haired? <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> in his Thalia makes the Indians 
    <lb/>blacke like the Æthiopians; which the experience of our times confirmeth. I know <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> will 
    <lb/>have the cause hereof to be the seede of the parents, which he sayth is not whiter, than of other 
    <lb/>people, but blacke. To whom <persName ref="#possidonius">Possidonius</persName> also subscribeth, and imputeth the matter of all this 
    <lb/>blacknesse unto Canicular heate, against which opinion I have nothing to allege. Let the truth of 
    <lb/>the matter rest upon the authors credit. But this as many men thinke more strange; that in all 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#america">America</placeName> there were no black people found besides a few only in one place called by them 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#quarequa">Quarequa</placeName>. What then is the efficient cause of this colour? Is it the drinesse of the heavens, or of 
    <lb/>the earth? is it perhaps some hidden propriety of the soile? Or a kind of fat licentious nature in 
    <lb/>the nature of men? Or is it all these variances in one? But these things we leave to be 
    <lb/>considered by them, who more curiously search into the secrets of nature.
    <lb/>This portion of the world is called by the Greeks <placeName ref="#libya">Libya</placeName>, and by the Latines <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, because it is 
    <lb/>not moistened with extremity of cold: or (if we may credit some) of <persName ref="#afer">Afer</persName> one of the adventurers 
    <lb/>posterity. Another derivation of the name you have (set downe by <persName ref="#johnLeo">John Leo</persName> in the description of 
    <lb/>his booke of the Description of <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>), who deriveth it from one blacke African, springing of the 
    <lb/>stocke of <persName ref="#cham">Cham</persName>, who first inhabited that part of the <placeName ref="#mediterraneanSea">Mediterranean sea</placeName>, from <placeName ref="#atlas">Atlas</placeName>, bounded by 
    <lb/>the <placeName ref="#nilus">river Nilus</placeName>, or rather as the best authors have taught us, the African soile called of the 
    <lb/>Greekes <placeName ref="#aphrice">Aphrice</placeName>, <placeName ref="#mareRubrum">Marce rubrum</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#redSea">red sea</placeName>. <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> reporteth, that <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> was first 
    <lb/>unknowne till <persName ref="#caesar">Cesars</persName> time, when it was found to be a third part of the inhabited world. <persName ref="#plinie">Plinie</persName> the 
    <lb/>like, and so doth <persName ref="#solinus">Solinus</persName>. <persName ref="#caesarScaliger">Caesar Scaliger</persName> gathereth of the word <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, that it is a name of the 
    <lb/>same import with aprica, that is, a sunne-shining place; for that this land lying open on every 
    <lb/>side to the Sunnes visitation, seemed thereby to have beene named so little other than of 
    <lb/>apricity. The principall regions of <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> have amongst themselves (as it were) a threefold 
    <lb/>division: first, from <placeName ref="#atlas">Atlas</placeName> in the West to the <placeName ref="#redSea">red sea</placeName> and <placeName ref="#arabia">Arabia</placeName>, whence it took the name of the 
    <lb/>first inhabiters, or else from the colour of the people, for the most part blacke and duskie; the 
    <lb/>second, to wit, the inner part of <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, from <placeName ref="#nilus">Nilus</placeName> to the <placeName ref="#kingdomCongo">Kingdome of Congo</placeName>, is more temperate, 
    <lb/>and not so much subject to the Sunnes heate; the third, which is next unto the <placeName ref="#southPole">South Pole</placeName>, by 
    <lb/>reason of the obliquity of the Zodiack, is more temperate than the former. The islands that 
    <lb/>belong to <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName> (some of which are expressed in the table) are <placeName ref="#madagascar">Madagascar</placeName>, <placeName ref="#canaries">the Canaries</placeName>, the 
    <lb/><placeName ref="#capeVerdeIsles">Isles of Cape Verde</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#stThomas">St. Thomas</placeName> situated under the equinoctiall, which aboundeth with 
    <lb/>fruits.
    <lb/>Among the ancient Writers none have particularly described this region. But concerning the 
    <lb/>same saith <persName ref="#isidore">Isidore</persName> in his <placeName ref="#etymologies">Etymologies</placeName>; <persName ref="#hanno">Hanno</persName> his navigation about <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>, in diversities; and 
    <lb/><persName ref="#iambulus">Iambulus</persName> his voyages, in <persName ref="#diodorusSiculus">Diodorus Siculus</persName>; and likewise <persName ref="#herodotus">Herodotus</persName> his Melpomene. 
    <lb/><persName ref="#bartholomeusGlanvilla">Bartholomeus de Glanvilla</persName> in his <placeName ref="#imageWorld">Image of the World</placeName> reporteth the like. Of late Writers reade 
    <lb/>also the Commentaries of <persName ref="#vascoDeGama">Vasco de Gama</persName>, <persName ref="#franciscusAlvares">Franciscus Alvares</persName>, who travelled <placeName ref="#aethiopia">Æthiopia</placeName>. But of 
    <lb/>all others <persName ref="#johnLeo">John Leo</persName> hath most exactly described it; as also <persName ref="#andreasThevet">Andrew Thevet</persName>, and <persName ref="#franciscusAlvares">Francis Alvarez</persName>, 
    <lb/>both travellers of <placeName ref="#africa">Africa</placeName>. Concerning the <placeName ref="#nilus">river Nilus</placeName>, the greatest in all the world, you have the 
    <lb/>letters of <persName ref="#johnRamusio">John Ramusio</persName> and <persName ref="#jeromeFracastorius">Jerome Fracastorius</persName>. Of <placeName ref="#africa">Africa itself</placeName>, as by me read at large in the 
    <lb/>second volume of <persName ref="#richardHakluyt">Mr. Richard Hakluyts</persName> English Voyages.
