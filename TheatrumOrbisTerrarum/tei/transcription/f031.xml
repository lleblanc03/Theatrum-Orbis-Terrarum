<lb/>The Prouince of [CVLIACAN.]
<lb/>THis Prouince of [CVLIACAN] is part of the kingdome of [New Galicia]. It was discouered
<lb/>vnder the gouernment of [Charles the fifth], in the year [1530]. In this region is one only colonie
<lb/>of Spaniards called, The towne of [S. Michael. Villages] here are very many, bujlt by the
<lb/>inhabitants; all which before the Spaniards arriuall were at their own libertie: yeelding obedience
<lb/>to no King or Gouernour. The region is indifferently furnished with things necessary. Out of the
<lb/>mountaines is digged great abundance of siluer. The inhabitants are addicted to war and robbery.
<lb/>They that dwell vpon the coast, employ most of their time in fishing; but the vplandish people
<lb/>liue by hunting. They goe naked, couering only their priuities with a piece of Cotton. They haue
<lb/>many languages. They lodge for the most part in the open air. They are the most beggerly nation
<lb/>
<lb/>[CVBA] and [HISPANIOLA]
<lb/>THis Island of [Cuba] is so called by the naturall inhabitants; but by the Spaniards [Fernandina]
<lb/>and [Joanna]; and (as [Peter] Martyr reports) Alpha and Omega. In length it extendeth East and
<lb/>West 300 Spanish leagues. The land is very mountainous, but rich of gold, and excellent copper.
<lb/>Madder, which the Apothecaries, because it is very apt to die wooll and leather, call Diers
<lb/>madder, is heere found in great abundance. It is in all places beautified with thicke woods, with
<lb/>riuers and pooles of fresh water : albeit there are lakes naturally salt. The woods breed vp
<lb/>Hogges and Kine in great plentie : the riuers sometimes yeeld grains of gold. It contains fix
<lb/>colonie or townes of Spaniards : the principall whereof called [Sant Jago], is the feat of a Bishop.
<lb/>But [Hauana] is the chiefe mart and hauen towne of all the Isle. Two wonderfull things
<lb/>[Gousaluo de Ouiedo] describes in this Isle : one, a valley extended betweene two mountaines
<lb/>some three Spanish miles in length : (the Ancients would haue named it, as in [Gallia
<lb/>Narbonenst], the now called [Prouence], The stony field) which bringeth forth round stones in so
<lb/>great abundance, that a man may lade whole shippes with them, being by nature framed so
<lb/>exactly round, that no Turner can amend them. The other is a mountaine not farre from the sea,
<lb/>whereout issueth a kind of Bitumen or Pitch in so great a quantity, that it runnes into the sea, and
<lb/>there floats farre and wide, according as it is carried by the waues or windes. This Pitch, they say,
<lb/>is very commodious for the calcking and braying of ships. [HISPANIOLA] lies to the East of
<lb/>[Cuba]. This Isle by the first inhabitants was called [Quisqueya], afterwards [Haiti] and
<lb/>[Cipanga] likewise. But the Spaniards name it [Hispaniola], and (of the principall city) [San
<lb/>Domingo]. The compasle here of is; 50 leagues. It is an Isle rich in Sugar, and it hath many Gold
<lb/>mines. It is very strange that is reported concerning a little flie very common in this Island, called
<lb/>by the inhabitants [Cucuyo], and as big almost as one of the ioynts of a mans finger, hauing foure
<lb/>wings, two very thin, and the other two greater and harder, wherewith the thin ones are couered.
<lb/>This shineth in the night as glowe-wormes doe with vs. The force of this light is not only in his
<lb/>eyes, sparckling like fire, but also in his sides, so that by lifting vp his wings, he shines more
<lb/>flying, than when he lies still. By the naturall curtesie of this little creature, all their chambers,
<lb/>they say, are so lightsome euen in the darkest nights, that a man may reade and write very plainly
<lb/>without the helpe of any other light. This light of theirs is augmented by their number ; so that
<lb/>many will giue a greater light than a few. Whoso deires a larger description of these Islands, let
<lb/>him reade the history of the New world written by [Jerome Benzo], [Perter Martyr] his Decads of
<lb/>Islands lately discouered, and other writers of [America].
