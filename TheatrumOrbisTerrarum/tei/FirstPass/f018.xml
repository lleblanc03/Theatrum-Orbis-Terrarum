<lb/> [Evrope]
<lb/>In the diuision of the world, diuers haue placed [Africa] in the third part : some few haue made no mere but [Asia] and [Eu
<lb/>rope] only ; and [Africa ] they make a part of [Europe], saith [Salustius]. This is that which [S. 
<lb/>Paulinus] in [Aulonius], out o
<lb/> the opinion of the same Saluit, thus writeth of : Europam Afiamque duo vel maxima terrae Membra, quibus Lybiam
<lb/>dubie Salluitius addit, Europæ admixtram : poffit quum tertia dici : [Europe] and [Asia] vast, the Earthly globe between 
<lb/>them share. Yet whether [Africke] should a part of this our [Europe] be ; or make a third part by it selfe, Saluit doth doubt 
<lb/>I see. But [Phiolstratus] also in [Isocrates] doth diuide the world into [Asia] and [Europe] : yea [Isocrates] himself, in his Pane-
<lb/>gyricos. Moreouer in [Varroes] booke De lingua Latina these words are read ; As all the world is diuided into [Heauen]
<lb/>and [Earth] : so [Heauen] is seuered into his quarters : and the [Earth] into [Asia] and [Europe]. Againe the same author in his 
<lb/>booke of Husbandrie writeth thus : first, when as the world, by [Eratofthenes], was very fuly and naturally divided into 
<lb/>two parts, the one toward the South, |[Asia] doubtlesse he meaneth ] the other in the north [[Europe] we call it.] [S. Augu-
<lb/>stine] in his 16. booke De Ciutiate Dei: [Lucane] in his 9. booke: and [Orosius] in the first booke of his history, haue the like
<lb/>wordes to the same sense. Notwithstanding custome since hath preuailed with all historiographers and cosmographers which haue written either in Latine 
<lb/>or Greeke, ioinly to diuide the globe of the earth into these three parts: [Asia], [Africke] and [Europe]: the last of which we have taken vpon vs to describe in 
<lb/>this place, not only in forme of a mappe or chart, like a Geographer: but in this present discourse, like an historian. Concerning the forme of it therefore, it 
<lb/>is manifold, as [Strabo] writeth. It is a Peninsula or demy-isle, and not an island; although [Silenus], as [Elianus] writeth, did sometime to [Midas] so relate of
<lb/>it. For it is on all sides, as you may see in the mappe, bounded and beaten with the salt sea, but only upon the East, where it is by a small necke ioined to the 
<lb/>greater [Asia]. Yet by vhat limis they are there distinguished, the ancient and the later writers do not altogether agree. For those which are more ancient 
<lb/>as [Aristotle], [Plato], [Herodotus], and others which do follow their opinion, do diuide [Europe] from [Asia], by the riuer [Phasis], (a riuer of Colchis falling 
<lb/>into the [Euxine sea], Mar maiore, or Maurothalassa, as the greeks call it) neere [Trapezonda] : some mappes do now call that riuer Faffo, others Phaz-
<lb/>zeth: the Scythians, (as [Theuet] reporteth, Debbaffethca) or which is all one, by that ithmos or neckland which is between the forefaid Mar maiore or 
<lb/>Pontus Euxinus, and the [Caspian sea] (Mar de Cachu, the ancient called it Mare Hyrcanum, the Hyrcanie sea) which formerly all old writers thought to 
<lb/>be but a bay or gulfe of the Scythian or Northren ocean, as [Strabo], [Pliny], [Mela], [Dionysius], [Plutarch] (in the life of [Alexander] and in his discourse of the 
<lb/>face in the sphere of the Moone) and [Iornandes] a more late writer, have I ft recorded. Yet all of them were deceiued. Only [Herodotus] truly (as this 
<lb/>our latter age doth approve and find to be so) doth affirme this to be a sea of it selfe, and to have neither in-let nor out-let, or to be intermeddled with any other 
<lb/>sea. [Dionysius], [Arrianus], [Diodorus], [Polybius], [Iornandes] and [Ptolemey] have diuided it from [Asia] by the riuer [Tanais] (Don or Tana, as now the 
<lb/>Italians name it) who think that both the rife of this riuer, and the land Northward from where it commeth, are both unknown and uncertaine. All 
<lb/>doubt where to place and lay their bounds : as indeed who never perfectly knew thoseplaces toward the East and North, not being then discovered, but only 
<lb/>described by them, from the fabulous reports of others: as for example, the Riphæan and Hyperboræan mountaines, which are feined inuentions of the 
<lb/>Greekes, a Strabo writeth: together with Aluani montes, heere described by Ptolemey, where not only these mountaines, but also no other at this 
<lb/>day, are to be seene: but in their places diuers huge and vast woods, great fennes and bogges, or large champion plaines.Orpheus also long since described 
<lb/>in this part of the continent I meane, between Mæotis palus, the fenne Mæotis, (now called Mar delleZabbache, and Mardella Tana) and the sea
<lb/>Cronium, an hugewood. Lifewise, Dionysius After heereabouts placeth an Infinite wood, as he termeth it, from whence he faith Tanais or Don doth
<lb/>Spring, which after many windings and turnings at lift falleth into the forenamed fenne Maeotis. Ifidorus heere hath the Riphaean woods, in which he
<lb/>saith Tanais doth first take the beginning. That Donaw (Danubis) doth diuide Asia from Europe, Seneca in the sixth booke Natural. doth manifestly
<lb/>Affirme; of which his opinion, what do we thinke, we will, God willing, set downe in the discourse to the Mappe of Dacia. Hitherto we see the forenamed au-
<lb/>thours to doubt and disagree between themselues of the limittes of these two parts of the world: if therefore they shall find me a meet vmpier and arbitratour
<lb/>in this matter, I would, not vnfitly, and as I hope to the liking of all parties, decide the controuer thus: I would make the bounds, to be Tanais, or the ri-
<lb/>uer Don; the straights or narrow peece of the maine land that is between riuer and the riuer Rha, (Athel) which emptieth it selfe into the Caspian sea:
<lb/>the East branch of the same Athel: then from his head vnto the riuer Oby, and so even vnto his mouth or fall into the Northren sea: For by this mouth, I
<lb/>do easily perswade my selfe, that antiquity did verily beleeue that the Caspian sea did vnlade it selfe into the maine Ocean. For that the name of this riuer O-
<lb/>by is ancient, it is very likely, for that montes Obij, certaine mountaines called Obij are placed heere about in this in this tract, by Athenaeus, which he saith for-
<lb/>merly were called of the ancient montes Riphæi, the Riphæan hils: but then in his daies montes Alpes, the Alpes. Againe Iornandes in this continent,
<lb/>not farre from hence, describeth Ouim, or Obim, a Scythian nation or family. And that these foresaid mountaines, are in this place (not where Ptolemey
<lb/>and Pomponius Mela haue placed them) very many men, of great credit and learning in these our daies, sufficient witnesses do stoutly auouch. Amongst
<lb/>which Baro Herberftein, in his history of Mofcouy, is one: Paul Oderborne, in his treatise written of the life of Bafilides, is another: lastly, Antony
<lb/>Wied, in his mappe of Mofcouy may be the third. Now they name it vulgarly by diuers and sundrie names, but commonly they call it Cingulum mundi,
<lb/>The girdle of the world, as the said Herberftein doth affirme. In a mappe of these countries set out by Master Ienkinfon, an Englishman, who travelled
<lb/>through these parts, it is called Zona Orbis, The girdle of the Earth. Moreouer I haue in some sort for this diuision, Iornandes and AEthicus, upon my 
<lb/>side, where they say that the Riphaan mountaines do part Asia and Europe. Againe these selfe same hils, yea, and in this tract, are the montes Hyperbo-
<lb/>rei; not where Ptolemey placeth them. And they are the same with montes Riphæi, Obij, and Alpes. Thus farre of the diusion of Asia from Europe.
<lb/>        [Pliny] calleth this part of the world, The Nurce of all Nations; [Mardonius], as [Herodotus] doth tell of him, auoucheth it to [Xerxes], to be by farre 
<lb/>the beautifulleft of all places of the World, to be a most goodly and gallant country, yielding all maner of fruits and fruitfull trees and those
<lb/>in their kindes and best; and to be such that it were pity that any king in the World should haue ought to do in but he. Varro in his bo kes Dere 
<lb/>Rustica, of Husbandrie writeth, That it is a more temperate and healthful soile than [Asia]. [Statius] in his Achilleidos, more than once or twice, calleth
<lb/>it, The Mighty prouince of the World. Maximaterra viris &amp; fœcundissima doctis Vrbibus, Europe for multitude of warlike men and scholers 
<lb/>deeply learned, doth farre excell thus [Mamilius] writeth of it. [Aristotle], the prince of Philospophers, maketh the inhabiters of this part of the world, to be, 
<lb/>A very stout and couragious people. The same authour affirmeth, that, All kind of beasts and cattell heere, are in their kind, greater, and stronger 
<lb/>than in [Asia] and [Africke]. But of the nature of this country, the maners and customes of the people, let vs heare what [Strabo] that excellent Geographer saith
<lb/>in his second book ; This part is most fertile of valiant and prudent men. It is all generally habitable, excepting only a very small portion toward 
<lb/>the North, and abutting vpon the Hamaxici, which dwell vpon [Tanais], (Don) Meo'is Palus (Mar delle Zabacche) and Borysthenes (Nieper or
<lb/>Dnester) which place, by reason of the extream cold, is not habitable. Yet certaine bleake and mountainous places inhabited, although in re-
<lb/>spect of the nature of the soile they are tilled and manured with greater difficulty, yet having gotten good skilull and industrious husbands,
<lb/>those also are tamed and much bettered, which heeretofore were badly vsed, and kept only by theeues and out-lawes. And indeed the Greekes
<lb/>when they dwelt vpon the rocks and mountaines, dwelt well and conueniently, by reason of their wife cariage in ciuill matters, arts, sciences and 
<lb/>knowledge of those things, which necessarily are required to the maintenance of mans life. In like maner the Romanes, hauing brought many 
<lb/>sauage and fierce Nations vnder their seruile yoke, seated, I meane, in places not very conuenient to dwell in, in respect of the nature of the coun- 
<lb/>try, either for that it was rough and craggy, or wanted hauens, or was too bleake and cold, or for other causes, taught them to vse merchandise
<lb/>before vnknowen, and haue brought them from a sauage and brutish life, to live ciuilly and more humanely. But those parts which are situate in
<lb/>an equall and temperat climate, there nature administreth all things necessary for the maintenance of man and beast. Now when as those Nations
<lb/>which do inhabite and dwell in fertile and rich countries, are maintainers of peace and quietnesse ; and those which are seated in barren and vn-
<lb/>fruitfull countries, are most hardy and stout : it commeth to passe that both are helpfull one to another ; while these do vle their weapons for 
<lb/>their countries defence, those againe do help and maintaine them by the profits that they raise out of the earth, by their arts and mysteries, as also
<lb/>by their learning, wisedome and policy : euen as in like maner also the dammage is mutuall and either side feeleth a sensible hurt, when the one
<lb/>part doth not helpe the other : yet the estate of the souldier and warlike man is somewhat better, if they be not ouercome with multitude. And
<lb/>the nature of [Europe] serueth very fitly for this purpose : for it is all diuersly distinguished by lofty mountaines and lowly plaines ; so that euery
<lb/>where the husbandmen and soldiers ; the politicians and the martiall warriers do dwell together : yet so as the greatest number are peaceable
<lb/>men : which kind of life they enjoy especially by the meanes and labour of their captaines, first of the Greekes, then of the Macedonians, and
<lb/>lastly of the Romanes. Therefore both in peace and warre it is sufficient of itselfe to maintaine and defend itselfe : for it hath great plenty both
<lb/>of stout soldiers, painfull husbandmen, and politique statesmen. In this also it doth, excell, that it bringeth foorth passing good fruits, such I
<lb/>meane, as are necessary for the maintenance of mans life: with all sorts of mettall, for what vse soeuer. Spices or sweet smelling things and preti- 
<lb/>ous stones, are brought hither from forren countries, WHICH THINGS WHOSOEVER HAVE NOT, THEY LIVE NEVER A WHIT 
<lb/>WORSE THAN THOSE DO THAT HAVE THEM. Moreouer this is especially worth the noting, that hauing wonderfull store of cattell, 
<lb/>sheep and oxen ; it breedeth very few dangerous wild beasts. Thus farre the learned [Strabo]. Many other things thou maist read of this [Europe],
<lb/>together with the nature and condition of the people of the same, in that treatise which [Hippocrates], the prince of Physitions, wrote of the aire and waters.
<lb/>This [Europe] also, and not any other place of the world beside, doth yeeld Succinum or Electrum, (Amber we call it, the Germanes, Glessum) yet it is not 
<lb/>found in Eridianus, a river falling into some Northren sea, as [Herodotus] doth fabulously report : or in Padus, a riuer of Italy (Po) as the poets iestingly af-
<lb/>firme: nor in the Electrides, certaine fained ilands in the Hadriaticke sea, as some men of better credit, and ore diligent searchers out of the [t]ruth, as [Pliny]
