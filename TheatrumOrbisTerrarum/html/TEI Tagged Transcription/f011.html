<tei-ab data-origname="ab">
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>my purpose was to represent unto thy view whatsoeuer heretofore thou had'st, or now hast, in any Geographical or Choro-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>graphical Chartes here and there lately or long since set out that euer csame to my hands, or were possibly to bee gotten for
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>loue or money. Of all country's whose descriptions are set out in out in Geographicall Tables, we have selected one (for of some
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>there are diuers) which in our indgement seemed to bee the best and most exact: Which, notwithstanding that it were, by
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the first draught of the <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Authour</tei-persname> somewhat large and broad, we haue brought into that small forme, as might agree with this
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>our worke, and that the whole <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Mappe</tei-placename> might be contein'd in one leafe: or, which sometime thou shalt obserue we haue done,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>as thou may'st see, that in one leafe many might bee contein'd and expressed: yet so as nothing, no neuer so small a thing, is
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>either omitted or altered that was to bee found in the greater: except it be this, which oftentimes thou shalt finde, that the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>names of places and other things, which in the first Copies could hardly be read,in these our Mappes we haue so expressed, that
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>they may perfectly be read of any man. And sometime, where occasion did serue,or need require,and the place would permit,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>unto the modern and usuall names of certaine places, wee haue added the ancient names mentioned by old writers, but now
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>uulgary unknowne. Which, as we doubt not, we haue done with the good leaue and liking of the <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Authours</tei-persname> themselues:
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>so I hope it will be a thing very well pleasing to all such as are readers and students of old Histories and Antiquities. In those
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Mappes, which haue their Authours names written upon them, we haue, as I laid, altered nothing at all, excepting two or
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>three of the Marine tracts of the Low-countreys, which the see hath changed since the time that their descriptions
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>were first set foorth: As for examples sake,in Flaunders,ouer against <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Zeland</tei-placename>,not farre from the towne Wateruliet, where
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>by the goodnesse and great benefit of <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Almighty God</tei-persname>, long after that the description of this Countrey was first set out , 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the Maine-land was much enlarged and had gotten an advantage of the Sea: wee there haue altered the forme of that Mappe,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>according as the place is found to be at this day. The description of which plot ground we obteined of Master Marke Lau-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>rine,the Lord and owner, thereof, a braue gentleman, greatlt renowmedboth for the noble stocke from whence hee is descen-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ded, as also for his wisdome and great experience. Eut in other Mappes, which had no name of the <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Authour</tei-persname> subscribed
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>unto them,we were somewhat more bold : for in these, in some places, at our discretion, where we thought good,wee haue al-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>tered some-things, some-things we haue put out, and otherwhere, if it seemed to be necessary,we haue put in. Of some Coun-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>treys also,that we might,as much as in us did lye,make up our iust number and fill up our ranke, be haue made some Mappes
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>of our owne, that there might as few Mappes be wanting, as possibly might be. In the abridgement and bringing of those
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Mappes,which had as i said the names of the <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Authours</tei-persname> added unto them,into a letter frome, we haue used that faithfulnesse
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and diligence, that we hope to deserue thankes not onely of the Reader, but also euen of the Authours themselues, or at least
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>we haue dealt so in them , that no man need be asham'd of these of ours whatsoeuer they be; yea he may aswell acknowledge
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and take this little one of ours,for his owne , as that first set out by himselfe. For wee have endeuoured to the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>uttermost of our power in this our worke, if it were possible, to deserue thankes of the <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Authours</tei-persname>, if not, uet by no meanes to
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>displease them: Not to follow or imitate that bad custome of some men in these our dayes, who, that they mat seeme to the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>world to set fouurth some new thing, does nothing els but alter the workes and labours of other men, and ostentimes, out of those
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>which are good, to select that which is not good, and to sell it commonly for the best: Sometimes by adding something at their
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>pleasure, and in some places againe taking out and detracting something, and witball either by concealing the right <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Authors</tei-persname>
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>names, or setting to their owne, or seyning a name of some one or other, they thinke to please the vulgar sort with nouelties,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>that that their worke may sell the better; and they may rake money together they care not how: For we were not mooued to
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>undertake this labour by any couetous desire of getting much by it, but even of a willing and forward minde that wee had to
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>helpe and further those that had a love and affection to these studies, not any whit respecting the gayning of any vaine glory
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and commendation by other mens labours. For what need we to make new Mappes, when as the old Mappes of other men,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>now extant, would serue our turne? Some there are peraduenture, which will looke to finde in this our Theater more de-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>scriptions of particular Countreys, (for every man naturally, for the love that he beareth to his native soil, would, I doubt
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>not, with that it were here seuerally described amongst the rest but let them know, that those which are here missing, are
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>not left out and omitted, either by our negligence, or for that we were lothe to be at that cost and charges: but because that ei-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ther we never saw any such, or at leastwayes for that there never came any such to our hands. If there be any man, which
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>either hath any such, or knoweth where there may be had, him we would earnestly entreate, that be would be the meanes to
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>helpe us unto them, assuredly promising him, that we will, at our owne coft and charges, not without great thankes to him,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and a most honourable mention of his name, cause them to be cut and imprinted apart and by themselves, that hereafter they
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>may be inserted into this our Booke, either in their owne place, elsewhere, as any man shall like best.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>	
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Of the Order also by us here obserued in the place of these our Mappes, I thinke it not amisse, gentle Reader, to speake a
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>word or two, and to acquaint thee with our purpose: that if peraduenture there be any man, which doeth thinke, that
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>can be looked for at our hands. First of all, we present unto thy view an Vniuersall Mappe of the whole world: Then,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the foure quarters of principall parts of the same; to wit, <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Europe</tei-placename>, <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Asia</tei-placename>, <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Africa</tei-placename>, and <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">America</tei-placename>: in this following dame Na-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ture, in which alwayes before the parts can be, the whole, whereof they be the parts, must of necesitie first be. Next after
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>these we have put the seuerall and particular Countreys of these parts, beginning at the West part of the world, in this fol-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>lowing Ptolemey the Prince of Geographers, and almost all others that have written of this argument: And so the Pro-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>vinces and particular countreys of <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">America</tei-placename> do first put foorth and shew themselves: next to these do follow the Brittifh
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Iles, after them Spaine, and then France. From hence we passe to Germany: whole Countreys being after our maner dili-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>gently surueyed, from <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Heluetia</tei-placename> or <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Switzerland</tei-placename> we passed over the Mountaines into <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Italy</tei-placename>, whiches the next countrey unto
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>it Eastward, purposing also to view all the Provinces thereof seuerally. From thence we croped the Sea Sayl'd into
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Greece. Whereupon going into <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Slauonia</tei-placename>, we surueyed all the Countreys seuerally which do vulgarly speake the Slaunian
