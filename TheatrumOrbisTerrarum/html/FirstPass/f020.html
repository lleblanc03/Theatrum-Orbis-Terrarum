<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>--saith, have seriously thought: nor in [Spaine], as [[AE]schylus] beleeued: nor in certaine rockes at the further end of the gulfe of [Venice, (mare Hadriaticum)]
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>as some mere suber men haue giuen out: nor in [Liguria,] as [Sudinus, Metrodorus,] and [Theophraftus] would haue men thinke: nor in [Ethiopia,] neere [Iu-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>piter Ammons] temple, or in [Scythia,] as [Philemon] imagined: nor in [Britaine,] as [Socatus]: nor in the [Gleflari[ae],] ilands in the Germane ocean, as [Pliny]
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>hathtaught: nor in [Bannonia] or [Baltia,] (a certain iland) as [Tim[ae]us] hath broached: nor in a certain riuer, as [Dion Prul[ae]us] hath taught: but neere vnto the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>neckland or peninsula [H[ae]ltarum,] in the bay [Pautzkerwicke] and [Frifch-haff, (Sinus Clilipenus)] in the Balticke or East Sea, not farre from [Dantzk] in
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>[Pomerell] or [Sprufe]: where hitherto it hath been taken (a thing wholly hidden from the ancients) to the great gaine and enriching of the Nations neere inha-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>biting: and not in any other place of the world beside.  In the same [Europe] are there many goodly and stately cities, among[st] the [w]hich the most famous, in all
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ages, are [Rome] and [Constantinople,] (which afterward was called [New-Rome)] and now are [London, Venice] and [Paris.]  The riuers of greater note
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>are [Rhein, Isther] or [Donaw,] and the [Thames]: the [m]oods more notable are [Ardene] in [Gallia,] 500.miles of length, reaching from the riuer of [Rhein] vn-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>to [Tourney] in [France;] and [Hercynia] in [Germany,] 40.daies iourney long, as [Pomponius] writeth, and 9.daies iourney broad, as [C[ae]ser] in his Commen-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>taries reporteth: a greater woodth in which, or more vast, there is no history maketh mention of. Thus much of [Europe.] But whereof it tooke the name
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and was so called, or who first gave it that name, I thinke saith [Herodotius,] there is no man vnder heauen !!!! doth certainly know or can vpon any probalibity
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>gesse, except one should think it so called of Europa Tyria.  But wherefore it should so of her be named, I am whollt ignorant, and I perswade my selfe and do
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>verily beleeue, that no man in the world truly know.  For that she, as we read in the fabulous stories of the poets, was violently taken out of Phoe]nicia, a
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>country of Asia, and caried from thence into Cyprus, or as others write, into the iland Creta (Candy) all men do know well enough: where, as Eusebius his
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Chronicle doth witnesse, being taken of Asterius king of Creta to wife, she bare him Minoes, Rhadamanthus and Sarpedon: from whence she went not into
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Europe, but into Asia, as Herodotus hath left recorded.  But what is that to Europe this part of the world?  One might easilier beleeue it to haue been so
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>named of Europus, who, as Trogus Pompeius witnesseth, sometime in these parts possessed a large kingdome: which also I do see to be auouched by Eusta-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>thius vpon Lycophron, who maketh this Europis to be the sonne of one Himerus.  Pausanias saith that one Eurpoa was king of Sicyonia, a prouince of
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Peloponnelius in Greece: to him Eusebius in his Chronicle doth ascribe, who makeuth him equall to the Patriarke Abraham, &amp; to hauve liued aboue 3550.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>years since, about 1950. yeares before the birth of Christ.  There be some, as Festus writeth, that thinke it so named of the beautifulnesse and excellency
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>of the country.  These we are sure are fabulous or vncertaine: may we not therefore, as they haue formed of Phrat, Euphrates, and of Koft, [AE]gyptus (as
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>we have shewed before) thinke that of Riphath (the sonne of Gomer, Iapheths sonne, to whom this part of the world was presently after the confusion at Ba-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>bel, assigned) they haue likewise formed Europa? And surely the name Riphath, doth very manifestly shew it selfe in Rhip[ae]is montibus, the Ripheanhils:
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>item in Riph[ae]o fluuio, now called the river Oby, in Ripe, a city of Peloponneses, in Rhiphat[ae]is, the people of Paphlagonia, as Iosephus writeth. Pto-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>lemey in the second booke of his Quadripartite, in my opinion much more truly, writeth that it was sometime called by a common name, C E L T I C A, name-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ly of a principall Nation that first did inhabite it.  For there is almost no prouince in all this part, in which in time past the C E L T A E did not inhabit.  For in 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Spaine toward the West, and beyond Hercules pillars are the Celt[ae] as Herodotus affirmeth, Item, abouthe riuer B[ae]tis, as Strabo auoucheth, the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Celtici Pre[ae]samarci, are in the prouince of Lucensis, and others otherwise named Nerij[?] as Pliny saith: Dion and Xiphilinus do shew that the Canta-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>bri and Astures are the same with the Celt[ae]: Pliny nameth the city Celtica, in the prouince Hispalensis. Antonius hath the Celti: item Celticum 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>promontorium, is the same that Cantabrum promontorium, which now is called Cabo de finis terre. What Geographer or Historian is he amongst the anci-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ents that hath not made mention of the Celtebri? In France were the Celt[ae] and Celtogalat[ae]: and from thence are those in Britaine. For that this iland
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>was first peopled from hence, lying so neere oueragainstit, it is a common opinion and very probable. That the Gauls Germanes were vulgarly called Celt[ae], 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>all Historiographers do iointly agree: and indeed Dion doth affirme, that the Celt[ae] did dwell vpon either side of the riuer Rhem: the Celt[ae] dwelt in Gal-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>lia Cisalpina (Lombardy) or Italy, as Appianus writeth. And again vpon the Ionian sea, (that is, the Hadriaticke), which also Strabo doth auerre.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Silius Italicus placeth them about the riuer Eridianus (Po). In Epirus sometime dwelled the Celt[ae], as Antonius Liberalis bath giuen out: Stepha-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>nus placeth the same about the mount H[oe]mus: Arrianus, neere the mouth of the riuer Donaw: as also Strabo in M[oe]fia. The same author writeth,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>that the Celt[ae] are intermedled with the Illyrij and Thraces. Who also placeth them vpon the riuer Borysthenes. Moreouer Aristotle in his booke De
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>mundo, ioineth the Celt[ae] with the Scythians. Heere hence the same Strabo and Plutarch do make their Celtoscyth[ae]. In Plutarch, in the life of Camil-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>us, I read that the Galat[ae] (which he maketh to haue come of the stocke of the Celt[ae]) passing the Northren dea came vnto the Riph[ae]an mountains. 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Againe out of the forenamed Strabo I learne that the nations dwelling Northward were in his time called Calt[ae]. The which also their ancient lan-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>guage, which is called the Celticke or Germane tongue, doth at this day sufficiently demonstrate: which is the same (only differing a little in dialect) 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>with that which is vsed in the ilands neere adioining to these places, as in Island, Groenland, Friesland and others in this ocean. Plutarke in Marius wri
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>teth, that Celtica doth begin at the outmost sea (that is, the Atlanticke Sea) and so stretcheth itselfe out farre into the North and from thence vn-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>to the fenne M[ae]Otis, (Mare delle Zabacche.) Pomponius Mela calleth the Cassiterides (which in another place we haue proued to belong to great Britaine, 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>or to be the number of those which are named Brittanic[ae]) Celticke Ilands. What is this else, I pray you, than plainly to affirme that T H E  C E L T [AE]  D O  
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>P O S S E S S E   A L L  E V R O P E ? Which indeed is that which Ephorus in Strabo did see so many years since: when as he diuiding all the world into 4. quar-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ters, saith that, That part which is toward the East, is inhabited of the  Indians: that which is in the South, of the [AE]thiopians: the North parts, of 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the Scythians: and the West, of the Celt[ae]. The scholiast of Appollonius nameth the Hadriaticke sea, Mare Celticum, the Celticke Sea. And Lyco-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>phron describeth Celtos, a certain poole, about the mouth of the riuer Ister. [Item he placeth] Leuce an iland of Mar maiore ([Pontus Euxinus]) o-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ueragainst the mouth of the riuer Donaw. [May we not therefore properly, as they call those that inhabit Asia, Asians: and those which dwell in Africa,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Africanes: call these which dwell in Celtica, Celtickes[.] He that out of all ancient stories, penned either in Latine or Greeke doth not know that the Celt[ae] are
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the Germanes, let him haue recourse to the 22. chapter of Hadrianus Iunius his Batauia, and I doubt not but, hauing throughly waied those many sound ar-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>guments, and sufficient testimonies of ancient graue writers, shall rest satisfied and sweare to our opinion. If not, let him listen to the] D[utchmen, and he shall
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>heare them call one another in their familiar communication,] Kelt. [The French also or Gauls I call a German nation. And I can proue by good arguments, if it
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>were a matter pertaining to this our purpose, that the Germane or Dutch tongue is the ancient language of the Celt[ae], and to be the same which [hithertothcy]
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>haue vsed in all places and now is spoken, except in some places where the power of the Romanes so preuailed, that they banished this, and seated theirs in the 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>roome. It is likely therefore that the etymology and reason of the deriuation of the word] Eurpoe, [which was vnknowen vnto the old writers, is to be sought
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and fetched from no other language else, but from that which was most [vsuall] in this part of the world. For that the inh[a]bitants of any country should take
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the name of their natiue soile from strangers, it is so absurd and hard to be beleeued, that there cannot any thing more foolish or contrary to truth be inuen-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ted or deuised. Wherefore I thinke it good, concerning this matter, heere to lay downe the iudgement of] Goropius Becanus, [our countryman, who thinketh
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>it to be so named, not of a woman, (which is probable, either neuer was, or neuer came heere) but] [a] latitudine videndi, [of the largenesse of his prospe[ct] (as
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>he speaketh) namely, because (I do cite his owne words out of the 9. booke of his] Origines) [it doth not only looke toward Asia, on the East and South: [Africa],
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>on the South and West: but also the New-found-world beyond the Hyperborei, on the West and North. Neither shall any man perswade me, that] Europe
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>[had the name from] Greece [or the Greeke language, seeing that is was first inhabited of the Cimbers] (Cimmerij,[descended from] Gomer, [the elder brother) before it was possessed of the Greeks] (Iones, [come from] Iawan [a yonger brother, [?] but the 4. son of] Yapheth) [we make a dipthong by setting the 5. vowel of the 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Latins before the 2. which neither the Latins nor Greeks do admit. Therefore if so be at any time they change the words in which this did light, for] We,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>[they put] Eu; [turning it backward. Therefore our men do term it] Verop, [not] Europ, [whereby they vnderstand a worthy] company of men: [for] Wer [(a mono-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>syllable pronounced like a dipthong) signifieth] lofty, great, excellent &amp; that which is best in euery kind of thing: [which not withstanding some do write] ur, 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>[without a dipthong, yet with a long vowell. Therefore, as of] Terues, [they formed] Tereus, [loof] Werop, [the Latines [&amp;] Greeks haue made] Europe: [so named of
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the excellency of the Nation, which doth farre surpasse all the other men of the World. For] Hop, [as I haue shewed before, signifieth a company or multitude of men.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>More of this word thou maist see in his] 8. [booke Thus farre out of his workes which are foorth in print: that which followeth, is taken out of a booke of his
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>which he also hath set foorth, yet not imprinted, but such as he vsed priua[t]ly, and hath many additions in sundrie places in the margin written with his owne
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>hand, which he had prepared against the second edition. But I waighing, saith he, and comparing this name with that which I haue read in holy Scripture, a-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>nother reason farre more excellent, and better commeth into my mind. We see that to] Yaphet [was promised enlargement or a farre spreading of his posterity,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>or as some other interpret the word, ioy and gladnesse: which then he truly had enioied, when as Christ had redeemed vs by his death and pretious [bloud] (which
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>blessing doth agree to this part of the world, rather than to any other vnder heuven beside: and therefore all other countries generali do call] Europe: THE
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>KINGDOME OF THE CHRISTIANS [: and the Europeans, are called of the Turkes and Arabians,] GAIVVR, [that is, Christians.)] E [, therefore
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>doth signifie a lawfull contra[c]t and mariage:] VR, [excellent: and] HOP, [hope: whereupon it commeth to passe, that] Europe [signifieth] The excellent hope
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>of a lawfull mariage. [which is proper to this portion of the world which] Noah [gaue to] Iapheth [ his sonne to inhabite. For although that the posterity of] Sem
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>[was by] Abraham, [for many ages wedded to God, yet at length he put her away and diuorced her from him. But the wedlocke whereby God, by Christ is wed-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ded to] Europe [his Church, shall neuer be dissolued: so that] Europe [may most properly be said to be] Iaphets [portion. But of this word we will speake more in
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>our] Francica. [Thus farre] Goropius. [Which I haue very willingly communicated to the curtuous Reader, leauing it to the censure of the learned to be ind-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ged. Yet I know that these things haue been very bitterly skoffed at already by a certaine learned man, but one wholly ignorant of this tongue, and therefore of
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>lesse [iudgement] in this argument. There are some which do think that this] Europe [was in the holy Scripture called] IAPETIA. [Thus farre of] Europe, [to
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>which before I do altogether leaue, I will adiout of] Herodotus [in his] Polymnia, [the words of] Mardonius [to] Darius [spoken of this country.] That it is a 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>country most goodly and beautifull, bearing all maner of excellent fruitefull trees, and those in their kind the best: and to be such that it were pi-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ty that any man but a king only should possesse.
