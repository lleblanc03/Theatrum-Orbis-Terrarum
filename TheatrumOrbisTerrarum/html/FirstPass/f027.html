<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>This sea albeit vnknowen, yet was it not vnnamed by ancient writers: for Plinie calles it Eoum,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> and Orosius Orientale, that is, The 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>East sea. Ptolomey falsly termes it Sinvm Magnvm, A great bay; whereas he should haue nam’d it Mare Mag-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>nvm, A great sea. For of all the seas in the world it is the greatest and the widest. In Paulus Venetus it is described vnder
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the name of Mare Cin, (that is, as I interpret it) of Nubiense Arabs, Bahci Itzni vel alkini, Mare Sinarum, (The sea of China)
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and in Haithon Armenus (whom elsewhere we more truly call Antonie Curctino) by the name of Mare Cathay. Well therefore
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>might it be named by the ancient and middle-age writers; but neuer was it fully knowen and discouered, till Fernando Magel-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>lan a Portugall sailed thereupon. Seene it was indeed, and as it were saluted in the yeere 1513, by Vasco Nunnez, from the 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>coast of Peru. But Magellan in the yeere of our saluation 1520. hauing passed the streight by him found, and called after his
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>owne name (which it hitherto retaineth, for euery common Mariner calles it The Streight of Magellan) with an heroick and
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Herculean courage entred this sea, which vncertaine it is, whether any hippe before his had euer stemmed. For meditating a 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>voyage to the isles of the Moloccos, whereunto the Portugals vsually sailed from West to East; and intending to make either
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>a shorter cut from East to West, he came at length vnto them by this sea: in one of which isles called Machan, he was slaine in a skirmish. The course of his
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>voyage was this: Departing from Sivvil with fiue ships, whereof one being his owne, was called by a name of good presage Victoria, he came to the fortunate
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>or Canary-isles; then to the Gorgones or Hesperides, now termed The isles of Cape verde; and thence to the Streight abouenamed: which when he had found
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and past thorow, he enters into this sea; where with a fresh and prosperous gale hauing sailed vpon the maine 40. dayes together, and beholding nothing but
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>sea on all sides, and till the sea; when he had crosfed the South tropick he descried two small barren and vnhabited isles: where notwithstanding, because they 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>found good fishing, they staied two dayes &amp; then departed, calling them the Vnfortunate isles. Now, they are knowen by the name of Tiburones, and the isles
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>of S. Peter. Then he proceeds on his nauigation, &amp; in the space of 3. moneths and 20. dayes, hauing failed ouer this vast Ocean 2400. leagues, he attained at
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>length to the Aequinocitall, and thence to the desired Moluccons. And because (as we haue said) he had for the most part a prosperous &amp; non tempestuous wind, 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>he named this Pacisicum or The peaceable sea, now called by the common Mariner, The South sea, or Mar del Sur. Those that haue written of the New
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>world, say, that this sea about thole vnfortunate isles, is most exceeding deepe, and that neere vnto the coast of Peru it yeeldeth pearles, and that there are in it 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>7449. isles, so that some in our times not vnfitly haue called the Western part thereof Archipelago or A sea thick set with isles: seeing this, like the Aegean sea
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>(which is planted all ouer with the Cyclades, the Sporades, and many other islands, and is called in the Italian tongue Archipelago) is also with isles most nota
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>-bly replenished. In the bottome of this sea Francus Ulloa and Antonie Pigafetta do report, that there growes a weed of 14. or 15. fathoms high within the water;
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and that it riseth out of the water to the height of some 4. or 5. fathom: so that sometimes you shall seeme not to saile thorow a sea, but rather thorow a greene
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>medow. The place of Aristotle in his booke De Admirandis &amp;c. doth not much disagree from this; where he writes of the Phoenicians which inhabited Gady-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ra, that when they had failed a while without the pillars of Hercules, they arriued at certaine regions abounding with weeds and slime, which were ouerflow-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ed with the tides of the sea. The very same affirmeth Iornandes in the beginning of his Getish history; where he writes, that none could saile thorow the O-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>cean, being impassable in regard of weeds or turfs, and for that cause vnknowen. Yea Plinie and Amianus also of Megasthenes haue left recorded, that all the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>East Ocean growes full of woods. And that there a tree called Porus should beare Okes laden with mast, Polybius reporteth in Athenæus. Also, that the Bay-tree 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>growes in the Red sea, the same authour affirmes vpon the credit of Pythagoras. Hereunto you may adde that of Theophrastus in his 4. booke of the history of
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Plants, cap. 7.8.9. and the testimony of Aelianus, lib. 12. de Animal. cap. 3. and Strabo, lib. 1.6. and Plinie, lib. 2. cap. 102. lib. 6. cap. 22. and lib. 13. cap. 25. and Plu-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>tarch in his naturall questions concerning the face in the orbe of the Moone. All these are in some sort confirmbed by PLatoes fables or histories in his timeus
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>concerning the Ile Atlantis; whose sea he affirmes to be vnnauegable by reason of the slime or oazenes remaining of the same Iles inundation. But concerning
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> the ship called La Victoria learne thus much: it is not sayd amisse: Bare names of times things named do resemble: Manifest it is by this ship, which vnder this
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> happy name, the first voyage that euer she made, was the only ship that caried away the victory of sailing quite ouer the maine Ocean, for so many ages before. 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>For departing from Spaine, by the Streight of Magellan, to the Moluccos, thence hauing doubled the Cape of Buona Esperança, and returned, whence she first
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> put forth, she was the first of all ships and images, that euer circumpassed the whole earth. The same ship made out of Spaine a second voyage as farre as S.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> Domingo and home againe. There also she made a third voyage; but in her returne she was quite lost; neither was it euer knowen what became of her. Anti-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>quity would haue thought she had beene taken vp into the skies, and placed among the Constellations, like another Argo. Nor had this propheticall verfe
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> of the peerelesse Poet beene vnfitly alleaged in her commendation. Then comes another Tiphy, another gold fleeced Argo. Let Plinie now cease to maruell,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> that out of a small hempe-seed should grow that, which was of force to carry vp and downe the globe of [this] earth. We in our age haue seene with the very
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>same thing this world of ours, much greater than his, nauigated round about. Ours, I say; which that you may more perfectly vnderstand, do but compare
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the first Table of our Theatre with the first of our Parergon or By-worke, and you shall see the difference.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>And here, I suppose, I shall not bestow my labour altogether in vaine, by adding certaine particulars not commonly knowen, concerning the first discouery
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> hereof. Which by all our late Writers is now vnworthily ascribed to Christopher Columbus. For in the yere 1492. he was the first man that laid it open, &amp; made
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> it knowen, and communicated the vse and benefit thereof to the Christian world. Howbeit I finde, that the North part of America (which hitherto neeret vnto
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> Europe, and to some of our European isles: namely, Groenland, Island, and Frisland; and is called Estotiland) was long since discouered by certaine Frislandish 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>fishers, driuen by tempest vpon that coast: and afterward about the yeere 1390, that it was reufited anew by Antonio Zeno, a gentleman of Venice: and that by 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> authority of Zichmi, then King of the said isle of Frisland, a Prince in those times very valiant, and ouer all that sea, for his warres and victories most re-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>nowned. Concerning this his expedition there are extant in Italian certaine Collections or briefe extracts drawen by Francis Marcolinus out of the letters of 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Nicolaus and Antonio Zeno gentlemen of Venice, who liued in the selfe parts. Out of which Collections I added this that followes touching the description of this region. Estotiland (he saith) abounds with all things necessary for mankind. In the midst thereof stands an exceeding high mountaine, from whence issue foure
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> riuers that water the whole country. The inhabitants are witty, and most expert in all kind of handicrafts. A language and letters they haue peculiar to them-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>selues. Howbeit in this Kings Library there are certaine Latine bookes, not vnderstood by them, which might perhaps before that time be there left by 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>some of their European neighbors that had traffique with them. They haue all kinds of metall, but specially gold, wherewith they mightily abound. They
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> exercise trade of merchandize with the people of Groenland; from whence they fetch hides, pitch, &amp; brimstone. The inhabitants say, that towards the South
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> there are countries rich of gold, and replenished with inhabitants. There are also many &amp; great woods; out of which they haue matter for the building of their 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ships and cities; whereof and of fortresses there are great numbers. Of the loadstones vse in nauigation they are vtterly ignorant. They also make mention of 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Drogeo, a region toward the South, inhabited by Canibals, and such as are delighted to eat mans flesh; for want whereof, they liue with fishing, which they very
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> vse much vse. Beyond this there are large countries and another New world; but the inhabitants are barbarous, and go naked: howbeit against the cold of Win-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ter they arme themselues with beasts skins. These haue no vse of metall; they liue by hunting. For weapons they vse long and sharp-pointed staues and
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>bowes. They make warres one vpon another. Gouernours they haue, and lawes whereto they yeeld obedience. Southward of this place they liue in a more 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>temperate climate, hauing cities and idol-temples, wherein they sacrifice liuing men, whose flesh they afterward deuoure. These haue the vse of gold and siluer. 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Thus much concerning this tract of land, out of the foresaid collection or extracts; this also is worthy the obseruation, that euen then our Europe-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>an pilots by meanes of that olde lande sailed those seas. For I am of opinion, that there is not to be found in any history a more ancient testimony touching the 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>foresayd vse of this stone. And these things I was the willinger to adioyne to this Table, because I see none of them that haue written the histories of the 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>world so much as once mention this matter.
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>But concerning the loadftone or fea-compaffe you are to vnderftand,that the firft inuentour therof was Iobn Goia a citizen of Melfi, whom Alexander Sardns
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>in hos booke De innentoribusrerun calleth Flanins Campanns. For fo write the Italians, and fo much is confirmed by Antonie Panormitanns in this one verfe of
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>his : Firft Melfi Sailors tangbt ,the loadftone bow to vfe, and that in the yere of our Sauior 1300. This Melfi called Amalpbis in Lstine, is a towne fituate vpon the
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>tea-fhore of Lucania. Goropius afcribes the finding out Danes or Dutchmen ; being perfuaded hereunto , because the names of the 3 2. 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>winds written vpon the compafle, are by all Pilots and Mariners, be they French, Spaniards,or of what nation foeuer, exprefled in the Dutch tongue : which
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>I confelIe to ve true, if you except the Italians only : fo was the fpeake of thefe winds in their owne mother-language.Howeit feeing all our na-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>uigatours of Europe, be they Spaniards,French,English,or Dutch,do exprefle them in our language, I am verily of opinion, that as it was firft found and vfed
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>by the Amalfitans ot Italians efpecially within their owne Mediterranfea : fo was was the knowledge therof from them derive vnto our Netherlanders,and inoft
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ot all to thofe of Brrges ; whofe city at that time (before all traff que was reduccd to Aniwerpe) was a famous mart-towne, and frequented by Italians,efpcci-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ally pf Venice ,as the foeaid Zeni report : and according to the teltimony of Peter Quirini, Cbriftopher Fioronari, and Nicolas Micbele, who in this our Ocean
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>fuffered that horrible shipwracke which we reade of in the Italian volumes : witnefle alfo Lewis Cadimofta, who in his Epiftles written about the yeere 1454,
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>a Fien;es this city of Brnges to be a Mart inferior to none elfe in the North parts of the world. Wherefore, that the citizens of Brnges rescind that vf, of
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>the fea-compaffe from the Italians, and out Italian tranflared the names of the winds into their owne language, and that from them the other nations be-
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>fore mentioned borrowed thi-knowledge, I fee not well, how it may be denied. Ofthe nature and admirable virtue of the loadftone you may reade many
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>notable things in Linius Sanasus his defcription of Africa, printed in Italiam at Venice. 
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>	Theifles ot Salomon, which in this table you fee defcribed about Nona Gninea, were not long finance difcoucered by Oliner Mendenio, after be had conducted
<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>his fleet out of the part of Lima in Pern,&amp; had failed ouer this hugeOcean : as I find recorded in Lofepbus Acofla his i .book &amp;17 .chapter De natura no::iorbus.
